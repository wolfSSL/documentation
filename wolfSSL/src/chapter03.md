# Getting Started

## General Description

wolfSSL, formerly CyaSSL, is about 10 times smaller than yaSSL, and up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL when using the compile options described in [Chapter 2](chapter02.md#building-wolfssl). User benchmarking and feedback also reports dramatically better performance from wolfSSL vs. OpenSSL in the vast majority of standard SSL operations.

For instructions on the build process please see [Chapter 2](chapter02.md#building-wolfssl).

## Testsuite

The testsuite program is designed to test the ability of wolfSSL and its cryptography library, wolfCrypt, to run on the system.

wolfSSL needs all examples and tests to be run from the wolfSSL home directory. This is because it finds certs and keys from ./certs. To run testsuite, execute:

```sh
./testsuite/testsuite.test
```

Or when using autoconf:

```sh
make test
```

On \*nix or Windows the examples and testsuite will check to see if the current directory is the source directory and if so, attempt to change to the wolfSSL home directory. This should work in most setup cases, if not, just use the first method above and specify the full path.

On a successful run you should see output like this, with additional output for unit tests and cipher suite tests:

All tests passed!
```

This indicates that everything is configured and built correctly. If any of the tests fail, make sure the build system was set up correctly. Likely culprits include having the wrong endianness or not properly setting the 64-bit type. If you've set anything to the non-default settings try removing those, rebuilding wolfSSL, and then re-testing.

## Client Example

You can use the client example found in examples/client to test wolfSSL against any SSL server. To see a list of available command line runtime options, run the client with the `--help` argument:

```sh
./examples/client/client --help
```

Which returns:

To test against example.com:443 try the following. This is using wolfSSL compiled with the `--enable-opensslextra` and `--enable-supportedcurves` build options:

```sh
./examples/client/client -h example.com -p 443 -d -g
```

Which returns:

```

This tells the client to connect to (`-h`) example.com on the HTTPS port (`-p`) of 443 and sends a generic (`-g`) GET request. The (`-d`) option tells the client not to verify the server. The rest is the initial output from the server that fits into the read buffer.

If no command line arguments are given, then the client attempts to connect to the localhost on the wolfSSL default port of 11111. It also loads the client certificate in case the server wants to perform client authentication.

The client is able to benchmark a connection when using the `-b <num>` argument. When used, the client attempts to connect to the specified server/port the argument number of times and gives the average time in milliseconds that it took to perform `SSL_connect()`. For example:

```sh
./examples/client/client -b 100 -h example.com -p 443 -d
```

Returns:

```text
wolfSSL_connect avg took:  296.417 milliseconds
```

If you'd like to change the default host from localhost, or the default port from 11111, you can change these settings in `/wolfssl/test.h`. The variables wolfSSLIP and wolfSSLPort control these settings. Re-build all of the examples including testsuite when changing these settings otherwise the test programs won't be able to connect to each other.

By default, the wolfSSL example client tries to connect to the specified server using TLS 1.2. The user is able to change the SSL/TLS version which the client uses by passing the `-v` command line option. The following values are available for this option:

* `-v 0` - SSL 3.0 (disabled by default)
* `-v 1` - TLS 1.0
* `-v 2` - TLS 1.1
* `-v 3` - TLS 1.2 (selected by default)
* `-v 4` - TLS 1.3

A common error users see when using the example client is -188:

```text
wolfSSL_connect error -188, ASN no signer error to confirm failure
wolfSSL error: wolfSSL_connect failed
```

This is typically caused by the wolfSSL client not being able to verify the certificate of the server it is connecting to. By default, the wolfSSL client loads the yaSSL test CA certificate as a trusted root certificate. This test CA certificate will not be able to verify an external server certificate which was signed by a different CA. As such, to solve this problem, users either need to turn off verification of the peer (server), using the `-d` option:

```sh
./examples/client/client -h myhost.com -p 443 -d
```

Or load the correct CA certificate into the wolfSSL client using the `-A` command line option:

```sh
./examples/client/client -h myhost.com -p 443 -A serverCA.pem
```

## Server Example

The server example demonstrates a simple SSL server that optionally performs client authentication. Only one client connection is accepted and then the server quits. The client example in normal mode (no command line arguments) will work just fine against the example server, but if you specify command line arguments for the client example, then a client certificate isn't loaded and the [`wolfSSL_connect()`](group__IO.md#function-wolfssl_connect) will fail (unless client cert check is disabled using the `-d` option). The server will report an error "-245, peer didn't send cert". Like the example client, the server can be used with several
command line arguments as well:

```sh
./examples/server/server --help
```

Which returns:

```text

## EchoServer Example

The echoserver example sits in an endless loop waiting for an unlimited number of client connections. Whatever the client sends the echoserver echoes back. Client authentication isn't performed so the example client can be used against the echoserver in all 3 modes. Four special commands aren't echoed back and instruct the echoserver to take a different action.

1. `quit` - If the echoserver receives the string "quit" it will shutdown.
2. `break` If the echoserver receives the string "break" it will stop the current session but continue handling requests. This is particularly useful for DTLS testing.
3. `printstats` - If the echoserver receives the string "printstats" it will print out statistics for the session cache.
4. `GET` - If the echoserver receives the string "GET" it will handle it as an http get and send back a simple page with the message "greeting from wolfSSL". This allows testing of various TLS/SSL clients like Safari, IE, Firefox, gnutls, and the like against the echoserver example.

The output of the echoserver is echoed to stdout unless `NO_MAIN_DRIVER` is defined. You can redirect output through the shell or through the first command line argument. To create a file named output.txt with the output from the echoserver run:

```sh
./examples/echoserver/echoserver output.txt
```

## EchoClient Example

The echoclient example can be run in interactive mode or batch mode with files. To run in interactive mode and write 3 strings "hello", "wolfssl", and "quit" results in:

```text
./examples/echoclient/echoclient
hello
hello
wolfssl
wolfssl
quit
sending server shutdown command: quit!
```

To use an input file, specify the filename on the command line as the first argument. To echo the contents of the file `input.txt` issue:

```sh
./examples/echoclient/echoclient input.txt
```

If you want the result to be written out to a file, you can specify the output file name as an additional command line argument. The following command will echo the contents of file `input.txt` and write the result from the server to `output.txt`:

```sh
./examples/echoclient/echoclient input.txt output.txt
```

The testsuite program does just that, but hashes the input and output files to make sure that the client and server were getting/sending the correct and expected results.

## Benchmark

Many users are curious about how the wolfSSL embedded SSL library will perform on a specific hardware device or in a specific environment. Because of the wide variety of different platforms and compilers used today in embedded, enterprise, and cloud-based environments, it is hard to give generic performance calculations across the board.

To help wolfSSL users and customers in determining SSL performance for wolfSSL / wolfCrypt, a benchmark application is provided which is bundled with wolfSSL. wolfSSL uses the wolfCrypt cryptography library for all crypto operations by default. Because the underlying crypto is a very performance-critical aspect of SSL/TLS, our benchmark application runs performance tests on wolfCrypt’s algorithms.

The benchmark utility located in wolfcrypt/benchmark (`./wolfcrypt/benchmark/benchmark`) may be used to benchmark the cryptographic functionality of wolfCrypt. Typical output may look like the following (in this output, several optional algorithms/ciphers were enabled including ECC, SHA-256, SHA-512, AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and Camellia):

```sh
./wolfcrypt/benchmark/benchmark
```

This is especially useful for comparing the public key speed before and after changing the math library. You can test the results using the normal math library (`./configure`), the fastmath library (`./configure --enable-fastmath`), and the fasthugemath library (`./configure --enable-fasthugemath`).

For more details and benchmark results, please refer to the wolfSSL Benchmarks page: <https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/benchmarks>

### Relative Performance

Although the performance of individual ciphers and algorithms will depend on the host platform, the following graph shows relative performance between wolfCrypt’s ciphers. These tests were conducted on a Macbook Pro (OS X 10.6.8) running a 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7.

![Benchmark](benchmark.png)

If you want to use only a subset of ciphers, you can customize which specific cipher suites and/or ciphers wolfSSL uses when making an SSL/TLS connection. For example, to force 128-bit AES, add the following line after the call to [`wolfSSL_CTX_new(SSL_CTX_new)`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_new):

```c
wolfSSL_CTX_set_cipher_list(ctx, “AES128-SHA”);
```

### Benchmarking Notes

1. The processors native register size (32 vs 64-bit) can make a big difference when doing 1000+ bit public key operations.
2. **keygen** (`--enable-keygen`) will allow you to also benchmark key generation speeds when running the benchmark utility.
3. **fastmath** (`--enable-fastmath`) reduces dynamic memory usage and speeds up public key operations. If you are having trouble building on 32-bit platform with fastmath, disable shared libraries so that PIC isn’t hogging a register (also see notes in the README):

    ```sh
    ./configure --enable-fastmath --disable-shared
    make clean
    make
    ```

    **Note**: doing a `make clean` is good practice with wolfSSL when switching configure options.
4. By default, fastmath tries to use assembly optimizations if possible. If assembly optimizations don’t work, you can still use fastmath without them by adding `TFM_NO_ASM` to `CFLAGS` when building wolfSSL:

    ```sh
    ./configure --enable-fastmath C_EXTRA_FLAGS=”-DTFM_NO_ASM”
    ```

5. Using fasthugemath can try to push fastmath even more for users who are not running on embedded platforms:

    ```sh
    ./configure --enable-fasthugemath
    ```

6. With the default wolfSSL build, we have tried to find a good balance between memory usage and performance. If you are more concerned about one of the two, please refer back to [Build Options](chapter02.md#build-options) for additional wolfSSL configuration options.
7. **Bulk Transfers**: wolfSSL by default uses 128 byte I/O buffers since about 80% of SSL traffic falls within this size and to limit dynamic memory use. It can be configured to use 16K buffers (the maximum SSL size) if bulk transfers are required.

### Benchmarking on Embedded Systems

There are several build options available to make building the benchmark application on an embedded system easier. These include:

#### BENCH_EMBEDDED

Enabling this define will switch the benchmark application from using Megabytes to using Kilobytes, therefore reducing the memory usage. By default, when using this define, ciphers and algorithms will be benchmarked with 25kB. Public key algorithms will only be benchmarked over 1 iteration (as public key operations on some embedded processors can be fairly slow). These can be adjusted in `benchmark.c` by altering the variables `numBlocks` and `times` located inside the `BENCH_EMBEDDED` define.

#### USE_CERT_BUFFERS_1024

Enabling this define will switch the benchmark application from loading test keys and certificates from the file system and instead use 1024-bit key and certificate buffers located in `<wolfssl_root>/wolfssl/certs_test.h`. It is useful to use this define when an embedded platform has no filesystem (used with [`NO_FILESYSTEM`](chapter02.md#no_filesystem)) and a slow processor where 2048-bit public key operations may not be reasonable.

#### USE_CERT_BUFFERS_2048

Enabling this define is similar to [`USE_CERT_BUFFERS_1024`](#use_cert_buffers_1024) except that 2048-bit key and certificate buffers are used instead of 1024-bit ones. This define is useful when the processor is fast enough to do
2048-bit public key operations but when there is no filesystem available to load keys and certificates from files.

## Changing a Client Application to Use wolfSSL

This section will explain the basic steps needed to add wolfSSL to a client application, using the wolfSSL native API. For a server explanation, please see [Changing a Server Application to Use wolfSSL](#changing-a-server-application-to-use-wolfssl). A more complete walk-through with example code is located in the SSL Tutorial in Chapter 11. If you want more information about the OpenSSL compatibility layer, please see [OpenSSL Compatibility](chapter13.md#openssl-compatibility).

1. Include the wolfSSL header:

    ```c
    #include <wolfssl/ssl.h>
    ```

2. Initialize wolfSSL and the `WOLFSSL_CTX`. You can use one `WOLFSSL_CTX` no matter how many WOLFSSL objects you end up creating. You'll just need to load CA certificates to verify the server you are connecting to. Basic initialization looks like:

    ```c
    wolfSSL_Init();
    WOLFSSL_CTX* ctx;
    if ((ctx = wolfSSL_CTX_new(wolfTLSv1_client_method())) == NULL)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "wolfSSL_CTX_new error.\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    if (wolfSSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(ctx,"./ca-cert.pem",0) != SSL_SUCCESS) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error loading ./ca-cert.pem,"
                        " please check the file.\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    ```

3. Create the WOLFSSL object after each TCP connect and associate the file descriptor with the session:

    ```c
    /*after connecting to socket fd*/
    WOLF SSL* ssl;
    if ((ssl = wolfSSL_new(ctx)) == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "wolfSSL_new error.\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    wolfSSL_set_fd(ssl, fd);
    ```

4. Change all calls from `read()` (or `recv()`) to [`wolfSSL_read()`](group__IO.md#function-wolfssl_read) so:

    ```c
    result = read(fd, buffer, bytes);
    ```

    becomes:

    ```c
    result = wolfSSL_read(ssl, buffer, bytes);
    ```

5. Change all calls from `write()` (or `send()`) to [`wolfSSL_write()`](group__IO.md#function-wolfssl_write) so:

    ```c
    result = write(fd, buffer, bytes);
    ```

    becomes

    ```c
    result = wolfSSL_write(ssl, buffer, bytes);
    ```

6. You can manually call [`wolfSSL_connect()`](group__IO.md#function-wolfssl_connect) but that's not even necessary; the first call to [`wolfSSL_read()`](group__IO.md#function-wolfssl_read) or [`wolfSSL_write()`](group__IO.md#function-wolfssl_write) will initiate the [`wolfSSL_connect()`](group__IO.md#function-wolfssl_connect) if it hasn't taken place yet.
7. Error checking. Each [`wolfSSL_read()`](group__IO.md#function-wolfssl_read) and [`wolfSSL_write()`](group__IO.md#function-wolfssl_write) call will return the number of bytes written upon success, 0 upon connection closure, and -1 for an error, just like `read()` and `write()`. In the event of an error you can use two calls to get more information about the error:

    ```c
    char errorString[80];
    int err = wolfSSL_get_error(ssl, 0);
    wolfSSL_ERR_error_string(err, errorString);
    ```

    If you are using non-blocking sockets, you can test for errno `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK` or more correctly you can test the specific error code returned by [`wolfSSL_get_error()`](group__Debug.md#function-wolfssl_get_error) for `SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ` or`SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE`.
8. Cleanup. After each WOLFSSL object is done being used you can free it up by
calling:

    ```c
    wolfSSL_free(ssl);
    ```

    When you are completely done using SSL/TLS altogether you can free the `WOLFSSL_CTX` object by calling:

    ```c
    wolfSSL_CTX_free(ctx);
    wolfSSL_Cleanup();
    ```

    For an example of a client application using wolfSSL, see the client example located in the `<wolfssl_root>/examples/client.c` file.

## Changing a Server Application to Use wolfSSL

This section will explain the basic steps needed to add wolfSSL to a server application using the wolfSSL native API. For a client explanation, please see [Changing a Client Application to Use wolfSSL](#changing-a-client-application-to-use-wolfssl). A more complete walk-through, with example code, is located in the [SSL Tutorial](chapter11.md#ssl-tutorial) chapter.

1. Follow the instructions above for a client, except change the client method call in step 5 to a server one, so:

    ```c
    wolfSSL_CTX_new(wolfTLSv1_client_method());
    ```

    becomes:

    ```c
    wolfSSL_CTX_new(wolfTLSv1_server_method());
    ```

    or even:

    ```c
    wolfSSL_CTX_new(wolfSSLv23_server_method());
    ```

    To allow SSLv3 and TLSv1+ clients to connect to the server.
2. Add the server's certificate and key file to the initialization in step 5 above:

    ```c
    if (wolfSSL_CTX_use_certificate_file(ctx,"./server-cert.pem", SSL_FILETYPE_PEM) != SSL_SUCCESS) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error loading ./server-cert.pem,"
                        " please check the file.\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    if (wolfSSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(ctx,"./server-key.pem", SSL_FILETYPE_PEM) != SSL_SUCCESS) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error loading ./server-key.pem,"
                        " please check the file.\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    ```

It is possible to load certificates and keys from buffers as well if there is no filesystem available. In this case, see the [`wolfSSL_CTX_use_certificate_buffer()`](group__CertsKeys.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_use_certificate_buffer) and [`wolfSSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_buffer()`](group__CertsKeys.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_use_privatekey_buffer) API documentation, linked here, for more information.

For an example of a server application using wolfSSL, see the server example located in the `<wolfssl_root>/examples/server.c` file.
