# Introduction

This manual is written as a technical guide to the wolfSSL embedded SSL/TLS library. It
will explain how to build and get started with wolfSSL, provide an overview of build
options, features, portability enhancements, support, and much more. 

You can find the PDF version of this document [here](https://www.wolfssl.com/documentation/manuals/wolfssl/wolfSSL-Manual.pdf).

## Why Choose wolfSSL?

There are many reasons to choose wolfSSL as your embedded SSL solution. Some of
the top reasons include size (typical footprint sizes range from 20-100 kB), support for
the newest standards (SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, DTLS 1.0, DTLS 1.2,
and DTLS 1.3), current and progressive cipher support (including stream ciphers), multi-
platform, royalty free, and an OpenSSL compatibility API to ease porting into existing
applications which have previously used the OpenSSL package. For a complete feature
list, see [Features Overview](chapter04.md#features-overview).
