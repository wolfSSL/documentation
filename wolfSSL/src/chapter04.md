# Features

wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL) supports the C programming language as a primary interface, but also supports several other host languages, including Java, PHP, Perl, and Python (through a [SWIG](http://swig.org/) interface). If you have interest in hosting wolfSSL in another programming language that is not currently supported, please contact us.

This chapter covers some of the features of wolfSSL in more depth, including Stream Ciphers, AES-NI, IPv6 support, SSL Inspection (Sniffer) support, and more.

## Features Overview

For an overview of wolfSSL features, please reference the wolfSSL product webpage: [https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl)

## Protocol Support

wolfSSL supports **SSL 3.0**, **TLS **(**1.0**, **1.1**, **1.2, 1.3**), and **DTLS **(**1.0**, **1.2**, **1.3**). You can easily select a protocol to use by using one of the following functions (as shown for either the client or server).  wolfSSL does not support SSL 2.0, as it has been insecure for several years.  The client and server functions below change slightly when using the OpenSSL compatibility layer.  For the OpenSSL-compatible functions, please see [OpenSSL Compatibility](chapter13.md#openssl-compatibility).

* [`wolfSSLv23_client_method()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfsslv23_client_method) - Use highest possible version from SSLv3 - TLS 1.2

wolfSSL supports robust client downgrade with the [`wolfSSLv23_client_method()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfsslv23_client_method) function. See [Robust Client and Server Downgrade](#robust-client-and-server-downgrade) for details.

For details on how to use these functions, please see the [Getting Started](chapter03.md#getting-started) chapter. For a comparison between SSL, TLS, and DTLS, please see Appendix A.

### Robust Client and Server Downgrade

Both wolfSSL clients and servers have robust version downgrade capability.  If a specific protocol version method is used on either side, then only that protocol version will be negotiated or an error will be returned.  For example, if a client that uses TLS 1.0 tries to connect to an SSL 3.0 only server, then the connection will fail; likewise, connecting to a TLS 1.1 server will fail as well.

To resolve this issue, a client that uses the [`wolfSSLv23_client_method()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfsslv23_client_method) function will support the highest protocol version supported by the server by downgrading if necessary. In this case, the client will be able to connect to a server running TLS 1.0 - TLS 1.3 (or a subset or superset that includes SSL 3.0 depending on which protocol versions are configured in wolfSSL).  The only versions it can't connect to are SSL 2.0 which has been insecure for years, and SSL 3.0 which has been disabled by default.

Similarly, a server using the [`wolfSSLv23_server_method()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfsslv23_server_method) function can handle clients supporting protocol versions from TLS 1.0 - TLS 1.3.  A wolfSSL server can't accept a connection from SSLv2 because no security is provided.

### IPv6 Support

If you are an adopter of IPv6 and want to use an embedded SSL implementation then you may have been wondering if wolfSSL supports IPv6.  The answer is yes, we do support wolfSSL running on top of IPv6.

wolfSSL was designed as IP neutral, and will work with both IPv4 and IPv6, but the current test applications default to IPv4 (so as to apply to a broader range of systems).  To change the test applications to IPv6, use the **--enable-ipv6 **option while building wolfSSL.

Further information on IPv6 can be found here:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6).

### DTLS

wolfSSL has support for DTLS (“Datagram” TLS) for both client and server.  The current supported versions are DTLS 1.0, 1.2, and 1.3.

The TLS protocol was designed to provide a secure transport channel across a **reliable** medium (such as TCP).  As application layer protocols began to be developed using UDP transport (such as SIP and various electronic gaming protocols), a need arose for a way to provide communications security for applications which are delay sensitive. This need lead to the creation of the DTLS protocol.

Many people believe the difference between TLS and DTLS is the same as TCP vs. UDP. This is incorrect.  UDP has the benefit of having no handshake, no tear-down, and no delay in the middle if something gets lost (compared with TCP).  DTLS on the other hand, has an extended SSL handshake and tear-down and must implement TCP-like behavior for the handshake.  In essence, DTLS reverses the benefits that are offered by UDP in exchange for a secure connection.

DTLS can be enabled when building wolfSSL by using the [`--enable-dtls`](chapter02.md#--enable-dtls) build option.

### LwIP (Lightweight Internet Protocol)

wolfSSL supports the lightweight internet protocol implementation out of the box. To use  this protocol all you need to do is define `WOLFSSL_LWIP` or navigate to the `settings.h` file and uncomment the line:

```c
/*#define WOLFSSL_LWIP*/
```

The focus of lwIP is to reduce RAM usage while still providing a full TCP stack. That focus makes lwIP great for use in embedded systems, an area where wolfSSL is an ideal match for SSL/TLS needs.

## Cipher Support

### Cipher Suite Strength and Choosing Proper Key Sizes

To see what ciphers are currently being used you can call the method: [`wolfSSL_get_ciphers()`](group__IO.md#function-wolfssl_get_ciphers).

This function will return the currently enabled cipher suites.

Cipher suites come in a variety of strengths.  Because they are made up of several different types of algorithms (authentication, encryption, and message authentication code (MAC)), the strength of each varies with the chosen key sizes.

There can be many methods of grading the strength of a cipher suite - the specific method used seems to vary between different projects and companies and can include things such as symmetric and public key algorithm key sizes, type of algorithm, performance, and known weaknesses.

**NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology) makes recommendations on choosing an acceptable cipher suite by providing comparable algorithm strengths for varying key sizes of each.  The NIST Special Publication, [SP800-57](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-57-part-1/rev-5/final), states how two algorithms can be compared:

> Two algorithms are considered to be of comparable strength for the given key sizes (X and Y) if the amount of work needed to “break the algorithms” or determine the keys (with the given key sizes) is approximately the same using a given resource. The security strength of an algorithm for a given key size is traditionally described in terms of the amount of work it takes to try all keys for a symmetric algorithm with a key size of “X” that has no shortcut attacks (i.e., the most efficient attack is to try all possible keys).

The following two tables are based off of both Table 2 (pg. 56) and Table 4 (pg. 59) from [NIST SP800-57](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-57-part-1/rev-5/final), and shows comparable security strength between algorithms as well as a strength measurement (based off of NIST’s suggested algorithm security lifetimes using bits of security).

**Note**:  In the following table “L” is the size of the public key for finite field cryptography (FFC), “N” is the size of the private key for FFC, “k” is considered the key size for integer factorization cryptography (IFC), and “f” is considered the key size for elliptic curve cryptography.

| Bits of Security | Symmetric Key Algorithms | **FFC** Key Size (DSA, DH, etc.) | **IFC** Key Size (RSA, etc.) | **ECC** Key Size (ECDSA, etc.) | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| 80 | 2TDEA, etc. | L = 1024, N = 160 | k = 1024 | f = 160-223 | Security good through 2010 |
| 128 | AES-128, etc. | L = 3072, N = 256 | k = 3072 | f = 256-383 | Security good through 2030 |
| 192 | AES-192, etc. | L = 7680, N = 384 | k = 7680 | f = 384-511 | Long Term Protection |
| 256 | AES-256, etc. | L = 15360, N = 512 | k = 15360 | f = 512+ | Secure for the foreseeable future |

Using this table as a guide, to begin to classify a cipher suite, we categorize it based on the strength of the symmetric encryption algorithm.  In doing this, a rough grade classification can be devised to classify each cipher suite based on bits of security (only taking into account symmetric key size):

* **LOW** - bits of security smaller than 128 bits
* **MEDIUM** - bits of security equal to 128 bits
* **HIGH** - bits of security larger than 128 bits

Outside of the symmetric encryption algorithm strength, the strength of a cipher suite will depend greatly on the key sizes of the key exchange and authentication algorithm keys.  The strength is only as good as the cipher suite’s weakest link.

Following the above grading methodology (and only basing it on symmetric encryption algorithm strength), wolfSSL 2.0.0 currently supports a total of 0 LOW strength cipher suites, 12 MEDIUM strength cipher suites, and 8 HIGH strength cipher suites – as listed below.  The following strength classification could change depending on the chosen key sizes of the other algorithms involved. For a reference on hash function security strength, see Table 3 (pg. 56) of [NIST SP800-57](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-57-part-1/rev-5/final).

In some cases, you will see ciphers referenced as “**EXPORT**” ciphers.  These ciphers originated from the time period in US history (as late as 1992) when it was illegal to export software with strong encryption from the United States.  Strong encryption was classified as “Munitions” by the US Government (under the same category as Nuclear Weapons, Tanks, and Ballistic Missiles). Because of this restriction, software being exported included “weakened” ciphers (mostly in smaller key sizes).  In the current day, this restriction has been lifted, and as such, EXPORT ciphers are no longer a mandated necessity.

### Supported Cipher Suites

The following cipher suites are supported by wolfSSL. A cipher suite is a combination of authentication, encryption, and message authentication code (MAC) algorithms which are used during the TLS or SSL handshake to negotiate security settings for a connection.

Each cipher suite defines a key exchange algorithm, a bulk encryption algorithm, and a message authentication code algorithm (MAC). The **key exchange algorithm **(RSA, DSS, DH, EDH) determines how the client and server will authenticate during the handshake process. The **bulk encryption algorithm** (DES, 3DES, AES, ARC4), including block ciphers and stream ciphers, is used to encrypt the message stream. The **message authentication code (MAC) algorithm** (MD2, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, RIPEMD) is a hash function used to create the message digest.

The table below matches up to the cipher suites (and categories) found in `<wolfssl_root>/wolfssl/internal.h` (starting at about line 706).  If you are looking for a cipher suite which is not in the following list, please contact us to discuss getting it added to wolfSSL.

### AEAD Suites

wolfSSL supports AEAD suites, including AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and CHACHA-POLY1305. The big difference between these AEAD suites and others is that they authenticate the encrypted data with any additional cleartext data. This helps with mitigating man in the middle attacks that result in having data tampered with. AEAD suites use a combination of a block cipher (or more recently also a stream cipher) algorithm combined with a tag produced by a keyed hash algorithm. Combining these two algorithms is handled by the wolfSSL encrypt and decrypt process which makes it easier for users. All that is needed for using a specific AEAD suite is simply enabling the algorithms that are used in a supported suite.

### Block and Stream Ciphers

wolfSSL supports the **AES**, **DES**, **3DES**, and **Camellia** block ciphers and the **RC4**, and **CHACHA20 **stream ciphers. AES, DES, 3DES, RC4, and ChaCha20 are enabled by default.  Camellia can be enabled when building wolfSSL with the [`--enable-camellia`](chapter02.md#--enable-camellia) build option. The default mode of AES is CBC mode.  To enable GCM or CCM mode with AES, use the [`--enable-aesgcm`](chapter02.md#--enable-aesgcm) and [`--enable-aesccm`](chapter02.md#--enable-aesccm) build options.  Please see the examples for usage and the [wolfCrypt Usage Reference](chapter10.md#wolfcrypt-usage-reference) for specific usage information.

While SSL uses RC4 as the default stream cipher, it has been obsoleted due to compromise. Recently wolfSSL added ChaCha20. While RC4 is about 11% more performant than ChaCha, RC4 is generally considered less secure than ChaCha. ChaCha can put up very nice times of it’s own with added security as a tradeoff.

To see a comparison of cipher performance, visit the wolfSSL Benchmark web page, located here: <https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/benchmarks>.

#### What’s the Difference?

A block cipher has to be encrypted in chunks that are the block size for the cipher. For example, AES has a block size of 16 bytes. So if you're encrypting a bunch of small, 2 or 3 byte chunks back and forth, over 80% of the data is useless padding, decreasing the speed of the encryption/decryption process and needlessly wasting network bandwidth to boot. Basically, block ciphers are designed for large chunks of data, have block sizes requiring padding, and use a fixed, unvarying transformation.

Stream ciphers work well for large or small chunks of data. They are suitable for smaller data sizes because no block size is required. If speed is a concern, stream ciphers are your answer, because they use a simpler transformation that typically involves an xor'd keystream. So if you need to stream media, encrypt various data sizes including small ones, or have a need for a fast cipher then stream ciphers are your best bet.

### Hashing Functions

wolfSSL supports several different hashing functions, including **MD2**, **MD4**, **MD5**, **SHA-1**, **SHA-2** (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512), **SHA-3** (BLAKE2), and **RIPEMD-160**.  Detailed usage of these functions can be found in the wolfCrypt Usage Reference, [Hash Functions](chapter10.md#hash-functions).

### Public Key Options

wolfSSL supports the **RSA**, **ECC**, **DSA/DSS** and **DH** public key options, with support for **EDH** (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman) on the wolfSSL server.  Detailed usage of these functions can be found in the wolfCrypt Usage Reference, [Public Key Cryptography](chapter10.md#public-key-cryptography).

### ECC Support

wolfSSL has support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) including but not limited to: ECDH-ECDSA, ECDHE-ECDSA, ECDH-RSA, ECDHE-PSK and ECDHE-RSA.

wolfSSL’s ECC implementation can be found in the `<wolfssl_root>/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/ecc.h` header file and the `<wolfssl_root>/wolfcrypt/src/ecc.c` source file.

Supported cipher suites are shown in the table above.  ECC is disabled by default on non x86\_64 builds, but can be turned on when building wolfSSL with the `HAVE_ECC` define or by using the autoconf system:

```sh
./configure --enable-ecc
make
make check
```

When `make check` runs, note the numerous cipher suites that wolfSSL checks (if make check doesn’t produce a list of cipher suites run `./testsuite/testsuite.test` on its own).  Any of these cipher suites can be tested individually, e.g., to try ECDH-ECDSA with AES256-SHA, the example wolfSSL server can be started like this:

```sh
./examples/server/server -d -l ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA -c ./certs/server-ecc.pem -k ./certs/ecc-key.pem
```

(`-d`) disables client cert check while (`-l`) specifies the cipher suite list. (`-c`) is the certificate to use and (`-k`) is the corresponding private key to use.  To have the client connect try:

```sh
./examples/client/client -A ./certs/server-ecc.pem
```

where (`-A`) is the CA certificate to use to verify the server.

### PKCS Support

PKCS (Public Key Cryptography Standards) refers to a group of standards created and published by RSA Security, Inc. wolfSSL has support for **PKCS #1, PKCS #3, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #8, PKCS #9, PKCS #10, PKCS #11,** and **PKCS #12.**

Additionally, wolfSSL also provides support for RSA-Probabilistic Signature Scheme (PSS), which is standardized as part of PKCS #1.

#### PKCS #5, PBKDF1, PBKDF2, PKCS #12

PKCS #5 is a password-based key derivation method which combines a password, a salt, and an iteration count to generate a password-based key.  wolfSSL supports both PBKDF1 and PBKDF2 key derivation functions. A key derivation function produces a derived key from a base key and other parameters (such as the salt and iteration count as explained above). PBKDF1 applies a hash function (MD5, SHA1, etc) to derive keys, where the derived key length is bounded by the length of the hash function output. With PBKDF2, a pseudorandom function is applied (such as HMAC-SHA-1) to derive the keys. In the case of PBKDF2, the derived key length is unbounded.

wolfSSL also supports the PBKDF function from PKCS #12 in addition to PBKDF1 and PBKDF2. The function prototypes look like this:

```c
int PBKDF2(byte* output, const byte* passwd, int pLen,
           const byte* salt,int sLen, int iterations,
           int kLen, int hashType);

int PKCS12_PBKDF(byte* output, const byte* passwd, int pLen,
                 const byte* salt, int sLen, int iterations,
                 int kLen, int hashType, int purpose);
```

`output` contains the derived key, `passwd` holds the user password of length `pLen`, `salt` holds the salt input of length `sLen`, `iterations` is the number of iterations to perform, `kLen` is the desired derived key length, and `hashType` is the hash to use (which can be MD5, SHA1, or SHA2).

If you are using `./configure` to build wolfssl, the way to enable this functionality is to use the option [`--enable-pwdbased`](chapter02.md#--enable-pwdbased)

A full example can be found in `<wolfSSL Root>/wolfcrypt/test.c`. More information can be found on PKCS #5, PBKDF1, and PBKDF2 from the following specifications:

PKCS#5, PBKDF1, PBKDF2: [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898)

#### PKCS #8

PKCS #8 is designed as the Private-Key Information Syntax Standard, which is used to store private key information - including a private key for some public-key algorithm and set of attributes.

The PKCS #8 standard has two versions which describe the syntax to store both encrypted private keys and non-encrypted keys. wolfSSL supports both unencrypted and encrypted PKCS #8. Supported formats include PKCS #5 version 1 - version 2, and PKCS#12. Types of encryption available include DES, 3DES, RC4, and AES.

PKCS#8:  [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208)

#### PKCS #7

PKCS #7 is designed to transfer bundles of data whether is an enveloped certificate or unencrypted but signed string of data. The functionality is turned on by using the enable option ([`--enable-pkcs7`](chapter02.md#--enable-pkcs7)) or by using the macro `HAVE_PKCS7`. Note that degenerate cases are allowed by default as per the RFC having an empty set of signers. To toggle allowing degenerate cases on and off the function `wc_PKCS7_AllowDegenerate()` can be called.

Supported features include:

* Degenerate bundles
* KARI, KEKRI, PWRI, ORI, KTRI bundles
* Detached signatures
* Compressed and Firmware package bundles
* Custom callback support
* Limited streaming capability

##### PKCS #7 Callbacks

Additional callbacks and supporting functions were added to allow for a user to choose their keys after the PKCS7 bundle has been parsed. For unwrapping the CEK the function `wc_PKCS7_SetWrapCEKCb()` can be called. The callback set by this function gets called in the case of KARI and KEKRI bundles. The keyID or SKID gets passed from wolfSSL to the user along with the originator key in the case of KARI. After the user unwraps the CEK with their KEK the decrypted key to be used should then be passed back to wolfSSL. An example of this can be found in the wolfssl-examples repository in the file `signedData-EncryptionFirmwareCB.c`.

An additional callback was added for decryption of PKCS7 bundles. For setting a decryption callback function the API `wc_PKCS7_SetDecodeEncryptedCb()` can be used. To set a user defined context the API `wc_PKCS7_SetDecodeEncryptedCtx()` should be used. This callback will get executed on calls to `wc_PKCS7_DecodeEncryptedData()`.

##### PKCS #7 Streaming

Stream oriented API for PKCS7 decoding gives the option of passing inputs in smaller chunks instead of all at once. By default the streaming functionality with PKCS7 is on. To turn off support for streaming PKCS7 API the macro `NO_PKCS7_STREAM` can be defined. An example of doing this with autotools would be `./configure --enable-pkcs7 CFLAGS=-DNO_PKCS7_STREAM`.

For streaming when decoding/verifying bundles the following functions are supported:

1. `wc_PKCS7_DecodeEncryptedData()`
2. [`wc_PKCS7_VerifySignedData()`](group__PKCS7.md#function-wc_pkcs7_verifysigneddata)
3. [`wc_PKCS7_VerifySignedData_ex()`](group__PKCS7.md#function-wc_pkcs7_verifysigneddata_ex)
4. [`wc_PKCS7_DecodeEnvelopedData()`](group__PKCS7.md#function-wc_pkcs7_decodeenvelopeddate)
5. `wc_PKCS7_DecodeAuthEnvelopedData()`

**Note**: that when calling [`wc_PKCS7_VerifySignedData_ex`](group__PKCS7.md#function-wc_pkcs7_verifysigneddata_ex) it is expected that the argument pkiMsgFoot is the full buffer. The internal structure only supports streaming of one buffer, which in this case would be `pkiMsgHead`.

### Forcing the Use of a Specific Cipher

By default, wolfSSL will pick the “best” (highest security) cipher suite that both sides of the connection can support.  To force a specific cipher, such as 128 bit AES, add something similar to:

```c
wolfSSL_CTX_set_cipher_list(ctx, "AES128-SHA");
```

after the call to [`wolfSSL_CTX_new()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_new) so that you have:

```c
ctx = wolfSSL_CTX_new(method);
wolfSSL_CTX_set_cipher_list(ctx, "AES128-SHA");
```

### OpenQuantumSafe's liboqs Integration

Please see the appendix "Experimenting with Quantum-Safe Cryptography" in this document for more details.

## Hardware Accelerated Crypto

wolfSSL is able to take advantage of several hardware accelerated (or “assisted”) crypto functionalities in various processors and chips.  The following sections explain which technologies wolfSSL supports out-of-the-box.

### AES-NI

AES is a key encryption standard used by governments worldwide, which wolfSSL has always supported. Intel has released a new set of instructions that is a faster way to implement AES. wolfSSL is the first SSL library to fully support the new instruction set for production environments.

Essentially, Intel and AMD have added AES instructions at the chip level that perform the computationally-intensive parts of the AES algorithm, boosting performance.  For a list of Intel’s chips that currently have support for AES-NI, you can look here:

[https://ark.intel.com/search/advanced/?s=t&AESTech=true](https://ark.intel.com/search/advanced/?s=t&AESTech=true)

We have added the functionality to wolfSSL to allow it to call  the instructions directly from the chip, instead of running the algorithm in software. This means that when you’re running wolfSSL on a chipset that supports AES-NI, you can run your AES crypto 5-10 times faster!

If you are running on an AES-NI supported chipset, enable AES-NI with the [`--enable-aesni` build option](chapter02.md#--enable-aesni).  To build wolfSSL with AES-NI, GCC 4.4.3 or later is required to make use of the assembly code.  wolfSSL supports the ASM instructions on AMD processors using the same build options.

References and further reading on AES-NI, ordered from general to specific, are listed below.  For information about performance gains with AES-NI, please see the third link to the Intel Software Network page.

* [AES (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
* [AES-NI (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set)
* [AES-NI (Intel Software Network page)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-advanced-encryption-standard-instructions-aes-ni/)

AES-NI will accelerate the following AES cipher modes: AES-CBC, AES-GCM, AES-CCM-8, AES-CCM, and AES-CTR. AES-GCM is further accelerated with the use of the 128-bit multiply function added to the Intel chips for the GHASH authentication.

### STM32F2

wolfSSL is able to use the STM32F2 hardware-based cryptography and random number generator through the STM32F2 Standard Peripheral Library.

For necessary defines, see the `WOLFSSL_STM32F2` define in `settings.h`. The `WOLFSSL_STM32F2` define enables STM32F2 hardware crypto and RNG support by default.  The defines for enabling these individually are `STM32F2_CRYPTO` (for hardware crypto support) and `STM32F2_RNG` (for hardware RNG support).

Documentation for the STM32F2 Standard Peripheral Library can be found in the following document: <https://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/USER_MANUAL/DM00023896.pdf>

### Cavium NITROX

wolfSSL has support for Marvell (previously Cavium) NITROX (<https://www.marvell.com/products/security-solutions.html>). To enable Marvell NITROX support when building wolfSSL use the following configure option:

```sh
./configure --with-cavium=/home/user/cavium/software
```

Where the [`--with-cavium=**`](chapter02.md#--with-cavium) option is pointing to your licensed cavium/software directory.  Since Cavium doesn't build a library wolfSSL pulls in the `cavium_common.o` file which gives a libtool warning about the portability of this.  Also, if you're using the github source tree you'll need to remove the `-Wredundant-decls` warning from the generated Makefile because the cavium headers don't conform to this warning.

Currently wolfSSL supports Cavium RNG, AES, 3DES, RC4, HMAC, and RSA directly at the crypto layer.  Support at the SSL level is partial and currently just does AES, 3DES, and RC4.  RSA and HMAC are slower until the Cavium calls can be utilized in non-blocking mode.  The example client turns on cavium support as does the crypto test and benchmark.  Please see the `HAVE_CAVIUM` define.

### ESP32-WROOM-32

wolfSSL is able to use the ESP32-WROOM-32 hardware-based cryptography.

For necessary defines, see the `WOLFSSL_ESPWROOM32` define in `settings.h`. The `WOLFSSL_ESPWROOM32` define enables ESP32-WROOM-32 hardware crypto and RNG support by default. Currently wolfSSL supports RNG, AES, SHA and RSA primitive at the crypt layer. The example projects including TLS server/client, wolfCrypt test and benchmark can be found at /examples/protocols directory in ESP-IDF after deploying files.

### ESP8266

Unlike the ESP32, there's no hardware-based cryptography available for the ESP8266. See the `WOLFSSL_ESP8266` define in `user_settings.h`
or use `./configure CFLAGS="-DWOLFSSL_ESP8266"` to compile for the embedded ESP8266 target.

### ERF32

wolfSSL is able to use the ERF32 family of devices for hardware-based cryptography.

To enable support define `WOLFSSL_SILABS_SE_ACCEL` in user_settings.h. wolfSSL currently supports the hardware acceleration of RNG, AES-CBC, AES-GCM, AES-CCM, SHA-1, SHA-2, ECDHE, and ECDSA on the EFR32 platform.

More details and benchmarks are available in the README.md in wolfcrypt/src/port/silabs of the wolfSSL repository tree.

### MAX32665/MAX32666

wolfSSL supports using the Trust Protection Unit (TPU), Modular Arithmetic Accelerator (MAA) and TRNG found on supported models of the [MAX32666](https://www.analog.com/en/products/max32666.html)/[MAX32665](https://www.analog.com/en/products/max32665.html#part-details) microcontrollers from Analog Devices.

To enable support define `WOLFSSL_MAX3266X` and `WOLFSSL_SP_MATH_ALL`. wolfSSL currently supports the hardware acceleration of RNG, AES-CBC, AES-GCM, AES-ECB, SHA-1, SHA-2, RSA 2048, and ECDSA.

This HW also supports the use of wolfSSL's crypto callback feature to allow the usage of both HW and SW implentations.

More details of the support can be found in the README.md at wolfcrypt/src/port/maxim of the wolfSSL repository tree.

## SSL Inspection (Sniffer)

Beginning with the wolfSSL 1.5.0 release, wolfSSL has included a build option allowing it to be built with SSL Sniffer (SSL Inspection) functionality. This means that you can collect SSL traffic packets and with the correct key file, are able to decrypt them as well. The ability to “inspect” SSL traffic can be useful for several reasons, some of which include:

* Analyzing Network Problems
* Detecting network misuse by internal and external users
* Monitoring network usage and data in motion
* Debugging client/server communications

To enable sniffer support, build wolfSSL with the [`--enable-sniffer`](chapter02.md#--enable-sniffer) option on \*nix or use the **vcproj** files on Windows. You will need to have **pcap** installed on \*nix or **WinPcap** on Windows. The main sniffer functions which can be found in `sniffer.h` are listed below with a short description of each:

* `ssl_SetPrivateKey` - Sets the private key for a specific server and port.
* `ssl_SetNamedPrivateKey` - Sets the private key for a specific server, port and domain name.
* `ssl_DecodePacket` - Passes in a TCP/IP packet for decoding.
* `ssl_Trace` - Enables / Disables debug tracing to the traceFile.
* `ssl_InitSniffer` - Initialize the overall sniffer.
* `ssl_FreeSniffer` - Free the overall sniffer.
* `ssl_EnableRecovery` - Enables option to attempt to pick up decoding of SSL traffic in the case of lost packets.
* `ssl_GetSessionStats` - Obtains memory usage for the sniffer sessions.

To look at wolfSSL's sniffer support and see a complete example, please see the `snifftest` app in the `sslSniffer/sslSnifferTest` folder from the wolfSSL download.

Keep in mind that because the encryption keys are setup in the SSL Handshake, the handshake needs to be decoded by the sniffer in order for future application data to be decoded. For example, if you are using "snifftest" with the wolfSSL example echoserver and echoclient, the snifftest application must be started before the handshake begins between the server and client.

The sniffer can only decode streams encrypted with the following algorithms: AES-CBC, DES3-CBC, ARC4 and Camellia-CBC. If ECDHE or DHE key agreement is used the stream cannot be sniffed; only RSA or ECDH key-exchange is supported.

Watch callbacks with wolfSSL sniffer can be turned on with `WOLFSSL_SNIFFER_WATCH`. With the sniffer watch feature compiled in, the function `ssl_SetWatchKeyCallback()` can be used to set a custom callback. The callback is then used to inspect the certificate chain, error value, and digest of the certificate sent from the peer. If a non 0 value is returned from the callback then an error state is set when processing the peer’s certificate. Additional supporting functions for the watch callbacks are:

* `ssl_SetWatchKeyCtx`: Sets a custom user context that gets passed to the watch callback.
* `ssl_SetWatchKey_buffer`: Loads a new DER format key into server session.
* `ssl_SetWatchKey_file`: File version of `ssl_SetWatchKey_buffer`.

Statistics collecting with the sniffer can be compiled in with defining the macro `WOLFSSL_SNIFFER_STATS`. The statistics are kept in a SSLStats structure and are copied to an applications SSLStats structure by a call to `ssl_ReadStatistics`. Additional API to use with sniffer statistics is `ssl_ResetStatistics` (resets the collection of statistics) and `ssl_ReadResetStatistics` (reads the current statistic values and then resets the internal state). The following is the current statistics kept when turned on:

* `sslStandardConns`
* `sslClientAuthConns`
* `sslResumedConns`
* `sslEphemeralMisses`
* `sslResumeMisses`
* `sslCiphersUnsupported`
* `sslKeysUnmatched`
* `sslKeyFails`
* `sslDecodeFails`
* `sslAlerts`
* `sslDecryptedBytes`
* `sslEncryptedBytes`
* `sslEncryptedPackets`
* `sslDecryptedPackets`
* `sslKeyMatches`
* `sslEncryptedConns`

## Static Buffer Allocation Option


By default, wolfSSL assumes that the execution environment provides dynamic memory allocation, i.e., buffers can be allocated/freed with the malloc/free functions. The wolfCrypt cryptography library, which wolfSSL uses internally for underlying cryptography operations, can alternatively be configured to not use dynamic memory. This can be helpful for environments without dynamic memory support, or safety-critical applications where dynamic memory use is disallowed.

### Basic Operation of Static Buffer Allocation

“Dynamic memory allocation” is a management method that dynamically finds/allocates and provides a buffer of a “specified size (variable length)”. Buffer usage efficiency is high, but processing is relatively complicated. On the other hand, the “static buffer allocation” provided by wolfSSL is a memory management model that searches for a buffer close to the requested size from among several types of buffers prepared in advance (statically) and provides it back to the caller. A memory block larger than the requested size may be allocated and returned to the requester of the buffer (thus reducing the efficiency of use). Although not as precise in memory management, it is simple and simulates dynamic memory allocation that dynamically allocates a memory block of any size.

Using static-buffer-allocation is equivalent in API to using dynamic memory with wolfSSL. This functional equivalency is achieved in wolfSSL by abstracting memory allocation/free into XMALLOC/XFREE function calls. Once static-buffer-allocation is set, wolfSSL will use it from then on to allocate buffers and other structures used internally. Since this feature is set for WOLFSSL_CTX, it will continue to work for the lifetime of the context object.

The static-buffer-allocation set in a WOLFSSL_CTX is thread-safe. Even if the same WOLFSSL_CTX is shared by different threads, buffer allocation/free is used under exclusive control inside wolfSSL. The following is a visual representation of the CTX structure, the arrows indicate passing a pointer to the heap and "..." references all structs and not to the ones listed.

![Alt text](CTX_structure.png)

In comparison to a memory pool functionality offered by an RTOS implementation, memory functionality in an RTOS will commonly suspend a thread (task) if an unused memory block cannot be found when requested until a free block becomes available. wolfSSL’s static memory functionality has no such synchronization capability.

### Specifying Static Buffer Use

With static-buffer-allocation in wolfSSL, it is possible to divide memory between two purposes. It’s possible to allocate and free buffers separately between general purposes and I/O use cases. The buffer used for I/O is set relatively large (about 17KB) to accommodate the maximum TLS fragment size of up to 2^16 bytes. This is different from the buffer sizes for other general uses. Additionally, when setting the buffer configuration the user can limit the maximum number of WOLFSSL objects that can be created simultaneously. If the maximum number of WOLFSSL sessions is limited, each use of the wolfSSL_new() function will check the number of WOLFSSL objects that can be created and will error out if the limit is exceeded.

### Enabling Static Buffer Allocation

Enable the static-buffer-allocation option when building wolfSSL. For systems built using Autoconf, specify “--enable-staticmemory” as follows:

```
$ ./configure --enable-staticmemory
```
Or if you are using a user_settings.h header, add the following macro definition:

```
user_settings.h

　　#define WOLFSSL_STATIC_MEMORY
```

The static-buffer-allocation option is implemented by default to fall back to the standard malloc() function when a NULL heap hint is passed in. If a heap hint is passed in and the memory associated with it is exhausted, an error will occur. If the environment does not provide dynamic memory management functionality, a link error will occur. Therefore, also define the **WOLFSSL_NO_MALLOC** macro to disable this feature if needed:

```
user_settings.h

　　#define WOLFSSL_STATIC_MEMORY
    #define WOLFSSL_NO_MALLOC
```

In addition there are two build configurations. `--enable-staticmemory=small` which is a
smaller version that has smaller struct sizes and less supporting API's available. The other build
configuration is `--enable-staticmemory=debug` that enables the ability to set a callback function. This is
useful in cases where printf() is not available for determining what is being allocated and what
bucket sizes are being used. Here is what the example client output looks like with example
callback:

```
./examples/client/client
...
...
...
Free'ing : 16128
OUT BUFFER: Alloc'd 6 bytes using bucket size 16992
Alloc'd 848 bytes using bucket size 1024
OUT BUFFER: Alloc'd 150 bytes using bucket size 16992
Alloc'd 13 bytes using bucket size 64
Alloc'd 12 bytes using bucket size 64
Alloc'd 848 bytes using bucket size 1024
IN BUFFER: Alloc'd 40 bytes using bucket size 16992
Alloc'd 13 bytes using bucket size 64
Alloc'd 12 bytes using bucket size 64
Free'ing : 1024
Free'ing : 512

...
...
...
```

### Using Static Buffer Allocation

This can be helpful for environments without dynamic memory support, or safety-critical applications where dynamic memory use is disallowed.

#### Static buffer setup function and its arguments

This can be helpful for environments without dynamic memory support, or safety-critical applications where dynamic memory use is disallowed.

```

int wolfSSL_CTX_load_static_memory(
      WOLFSSL_CTX** ctx, /* address of the variable to hold WOLFSSL_CTX */
      wolfSSL_method_func method,/* method pointer */
      unsigned char* buf,   /* pointer to the buffer to use as heap */
      unsigned int sz,      /* buffer size */
      int flag,              /* heap usage */
      int max);              /* maximum number of objects allowed */

```

* parameter **ctx** specifies the address of a variable that receives a pointer to the generated WOLFSSL_CTX structure.

* parameter **method** specifies a function pointer with "_ex", such as wolfSSLv23_client_method_ex(). The functions that can be used are listed in a later chapter.

* parameter **buf** and **sz** specify the address and size of the buffer used for the heap, respectively. For information on determining the buffer size to be set, see “**Obtaining the Required Buffer Size**”.

* parameter **flag** is a flag that specifies the usage of the buffer. You can also specify whether to track the allocation status. When specifying for general use, specify "**0**" or **WOLFMEM_GENERAL**. For I/O use, specify **WOLFMEM_IO_POOL** or **WOLFMEM_IO_POOL_FIXED**. When tracking the allocation status of static buffers, **OR** the value specifying the usage with **WOLFMEM_TRACK_STATS**.

* parameter **max** is related to the use of the buffer specified by the argument flag. If the buffer is for general use, you may want to set the maximum number of WOLFSSL objects that can be generated simultaneously (the number of objects that can exist at the same time). Specify **0** if there is **no need to limit**. If you specify a limit value other than 0, subsequent calls to wolfSSL_new() will fail if the number of concurrent WOLFSSL objects created exceeds the set value.

#### How to call the static buffer setup function

When using the static-buffer-allocation option, call the wolfSSL_CTX_load_static_memory() function **twice**. The first sets up a buffer for general use, and then uses that buffer to allocate a WOLFSSL_CTX structure. The second call sets up the I/O buffer:

```
WOLFSSL_CTX* ctx = NULL; /* pass NULL to generate WOLFSSL_CTX */
int ret;

#define MAX_CONCURRENT_TLS  0
#define MAX_CONCURRENT_IO   0

unsigned char GEN_MEM[GEN_MEM_SIZE];
unsigned char IO_MEM[IO_MEM_SIZE];　

  /* set up a general-purpose buffer and generate WOLFSSL_CTX from it on the first call. */
   ret = wolfSSL_CTX_load_static_memory(
           &ctx,                               /* set NULL to ctx */
           wolfSSLv23_client_method_ex(),  /* use function with "_ex" */
           GEN_MEM, GEN_MEM_SIZE,            /* buffer and its size */
           WOLFMEM_GENERAL,                  /* general purpose */
           MAX_CONCURRENT_TLS);              /* max concurrent objects */

   /* set up a I/O-purpose buffer on the second call. */
   ret = wolfSSL_CTX_load_static_memory(
           &ctx,                /* make sure ctx is holding the object */
           NULL,                           /* pass it to NULL this time */
           IO_MEM, IO_MEM_SIZE,                /* buffer and its size */
           WOLFMEM_IO_FIXED,                             /* I/O purpose */
           MAX_CONCURRENT_IO);               /* max concurrent objects */

```

After this, when you are done using the WOLFSSL_CTX structure, free it with the usual wolfSSL_CTX_free().

#### Setting a Global Heap Hint

A global heap hint can be set using the API `void* wolfSSL_SetGlobalHeapHint(void* heap)`.
When a global heap hint is set all calls to XMALLOC and XFREE using a NULL pointer as the
heap hint will be redirected to use the global heap hint set. This is useful in cases where
no system malloc is available to fall back to and NULL heap hint pointers are being used.
The function wolfSSL_SetGlobalHeapHint returns the current global heap hint set, and is NOT
considered to be thread safe.

The getter function `void* wolfSSL_GetGlobalHeapHint(void)` can be used to get the current
global heap hint set.

This functionality was added in versions of wolfSSL after version 5.7.0.

### Adjustment of Static Buffer Allocation

The static-buffer-allocation option provided by wolfSSL manages the specified buffer by dividing it into multiple areas called "buckets" as shown in the following diagram. Multiple memory blocks of the same size are linked within a bucket. The figure below omits the structure that manages the memory block, but a buffer with a size that includes the omitted structure is required.

![Alt text](buckets.png)

#### Macros for General Use Buffers

Each bucket varies in size depending on the number of memory blocks it contains and their size. 

The memory block size and number of blocks for each area to be used are defined in /wolfssl/wolfcrypt/memory.h with the following macros:

```
/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/memory.h

   #define WOLFSSL_STATIC_ALIGN 16  /* alignment 16 bytes by default*/
   #define WOLFMEM_MAX_BUCKETS  9　　/* number of buckets */
 　#define WOLFMEM_IO_SZ         16992   /* buffer size for I/O  */
   #define LARGEST_MEM_BUCKET   16128   /* the max block size */   
   #define WOLFMEM_BUCKETS      64,128,256,512,1024,2432,3456,
                                                   4544,LARGEST_MEM_BUCKET
   #define WOLFMEM_DIST         49,10,6,14,5,6,9,1,1

```

* **WOLFSSL_STATIC_ALIGN** specifies the buffer alignment size. 16 bytes by default. You need to change it according to the alignment size of your MCU.
* **WOLFMEM_MAX_BUCKETS** shows the number of buckets. This means using 9 different bucket sizes.
* **WOLFMEM_BUCKETS** specifies the number of bytes in blocks in each bucket, separated by commas, from smallest to largest. This definition applies to general purpose buffers.

* **WOLFMEM_DIST** specifies the number of same-sized blocks in each bucket, separated by commas, corresponding to each block in WOLFMEM_BUCKETS. This definition applies to general purpose buffers.

In the example above, a bucket with a block size of 64 bytes is the minimum size, and that bucket would have 49 memory blocks. The next larger bucket means 10 memory blocks with a block size of 128 bytes. The above defined values can be used as default values, but the size of each bucket and the number of memory blocks it contains may need to be adjusted when used in an actual environment.

#### Macros for I/O Use Buffers

For TLS client

- `wolfTLSv1_3_client_method_ex`

## Compression

wolfSSL supports data compression with the **zlib** library. The `./configure` build system detects the presence of this library, but if you're building in some other way define the constant `HAVE_LIBZ` and include the path to zlib.h for your includes.

Compression is off by default for a given cipher. To turn it on, use the function [`wolfSSL_set_compression()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfssl_set_compression) before SSL connecting or accepting. Both the client and server must have compression turned on in order for compression to be used.

Keep in mind that while compressing data before sending decreases the actual size of the messages being sent and received, the amount of data saved by compression usually takes longer time to analyze than it does to send it raw on all but the slowest of networks.

## Pre-Shared Keys

wolfSSL has support for these ciphers with static pre-shared keys:

* `TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA384`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8`
* `TLS_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305`

These suites are built into wolfSSL with `WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK` on, all PSK suites can be turned off at build time with the constant `NO_PSK`. To only use these ciphers at runtime use the function [`wolfSSL_CTX_set_cipher_list()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_set_cipher_list) with the desired ciphersuite.

wolfSSL has support for ephemeral key PSK suites:

* `ECDHE-PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA256`
* `ECDHE-PSK-NULL-SHA256`
* `ECDHE-PSK-CHACHA20-POLY1305`
* `DHE-PSK-CHACHA20-POLY1305`
* `DHE-PSK-AES256-GCM-SHA384`
* `DHE-PSK-AES128-GCM-SHA256`
* `DHE-PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA384`
* `DHE-PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA256`
* `DHE-PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA256`

On the client, use the function [`wolfSSL_CTX_set_psk_client_callback()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_set_psk_client_callback) to setup the callback. The client example in `<wolfSSL_Home>/examples/client/client.c` gives example usage for setting up the client identity and key, though the actual callback is implemented in `wolfssl/test.h`.

On the server side two additional calls are required:

* [`wolfSSL_CTX_set_psk_server_callback()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_set_psk_server_callback)
* [`wolfSSL_CTX_use_psk_identity_hint()`](group__CertsKeys.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_use_psk_identity_hint)

The server stores its identity hint to help the client with the 2nd call, in our server example that's "wolfssl server".  An example server psk callback can also be found in `my_psk_server_cb()` in `wolfssl/test.h`.

wolfSSL supports identities and hints up to 128 octets and pre-shared keys up to 64 octets.

## Client Authentication

Client authentication is a feature which enables the server to authenticate clients by requesting that the clients send a certificate to the server for authentication when they connect. Client authentication requires an X.509 client certificate from a CA (or self-signed if generated by you or someone other than a CA).

By default, wolfSSL validates all certificates that it receives - this includes both client and server. To set up client authentication, the server must load the list of trusted CA certificates to be used to verify the client certificate against:

```c
wolfSSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(ctx, caCert, 0);
```

To turn on client verification and control its behavior, the [`wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_set_verify) function is used.  In the following example, `SSL_VERIFY_PEER` turns on a certificate request from the server to the client.  `SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT` instructs the server to fail if the client does not present a certificate to validate on the server side.  Other options to [`wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_set_verify) include `SSL_VERIFY_NONE` and `SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE`.

```c
wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx,SSL_VERIFY_PEER | ((usePskPlus)?
                       SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_EXCEPT_PSK :
                       SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT),0);
```

An example of client authentication can be found in the example server (`server.c`) included in the wolfSSL download (`/examples/server/server.c`).

## Server Name Indication

SNI is useful when a server hosts multiple ‘virtual’ servers at a single underlying network address. It may be desirable for clients to provide the name of the server which it is contacting. To enable SNI with wolfSSL you can simply do:

```sh
./configure --enable-sni
```

Using SNI on the client side requires an additional function call, which should be one of the following functions:

* [`wolfSSL_CTX_UseSNI()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_usesni)
* [`wolfSSL_UseSNI()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_usesni)

[`wolfSSL_CTX_UseSNI()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_usesni) is most recommended when the client contacts the same server multiple times. Setting the SNI extension at the context level will enable the SNI usage in all SSL objects created from that same context from the moment of the call forward.

[`wolfSSL_UseSNI()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_usesni) will enable SNI usage for one SSL object only, so it is recommended to use this function when the server name changes between sessions.

On the server side one of the same function calls is required. Since the wolfSSL server doesn't host multiple 'virtual' servers, the SNI usage is useful when the termination of the connection is desired in the case of SNI mismatch. In this scenario, [`wolfSSL_CTX_UseSNI()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_usesni) will be more efficient, as the server will set it only once per context creating all subsequent SSL objects with SNI from that same context.

## Handshake Modifications

### Grouping Handshake Messages

wolfSSL has the ability to group handshake messages if the user desires.  This can be done at the context level with [`wolfSSL_CTX_set_group_messages(ctx);`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfssl_ct_set_group_messages) or at the SSL object level with [`wolfSSL_set_group_messages(ssl);`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfssl_set_group_messages).

## Truncated HMAC

Currently defined TLS cipher suites use the HMAC to authenticate record-layer communications. In TLS, the entire output of the hash function is used as the MAC tag. However, it may be desirable in constrained environments to save bandwidth by truncating the output of the hash function to 80 bits when forming MAC tags. To enable the usage of Truncated HMAC at wolfSSL you can simply do:

```sh
./configure --enable-truncatedhmac
```

Using Truncated HMAC on the client side requires an additional function call, which should be one of the following functions:

* [`wolfSSL_CTX_UseTruncatedHMAC()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_usetruncatedhmac)
* [`wolfSSL_UseTruncatedHMAC()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_usetruncatedhmac)

[`wolfSSL_CTX_UseTruncatedHMAC()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_usetrunctatedhmac) is most recommended when the client would like to enable Truncated HMAC for all sessions. Setting the Truncated HMAC extension at context level will enable it in all SSL objects created from that same context from the moment of the call forward.

[`wolfSSL_UseTruncatedHMAC()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_usetruncatedhmac) will enable it for one SSL object only, so it's recommended to use this function when there is no need for Truncated HMAC on all sessions.

On the server side no call is required. The server will automatically attend to the client's request for Truncated HMAC.

All TLS extensions can also be enabled with:

```sh
./configure --enable-tlsx
```

## User Crypto Module

User Crypto Module allows for a user to plug in custom crypto that they want used during supported operations (Currently RSA operations are supported). An example of a module is located in the directory `root_wolfssl/wolfcrypt/user-crypto/` using IPP libraries. Examples of the configure option when building wolfSSL to use a crypto module is as follows:

```sh
./configure --with-user-crypto
```

or

```sh
./configure --with-user-crypto=/dir/to
```

When creating a user crypto module that performs RSA operations, it is mandatory that there is a header file for RSA called `user_rsa.h`. For all user crypto operations it is mandatory that the users library be called `libusercrypto`. These are the names that wolfSSL autoconf tools will be looking for when linking and using a user crypto module. In the example provided with wolfSSL, the header file `user_rsa.h` can be found in the directory `wolfcrypt/user-crypto/include/` and the library once created is located in the directory `wolfcrypt/user-crypto/lib/`. For a list of required API look at the header file provided.

To build the example, after having installed IPP libraries, the following commands from the root wolfSSL directory should be ran.

```sh
cd wolfcrypt/user-crypto/
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

The included example in wolfSSL requires the use of IPP, which will need to be installed before the project can be built. Though even if not having IPP libraries to build the example it is intended to provide users with an example of file name choice and API interface. Once having made and installed both the library libusercrypto and header files, making wolfSSL use the crypto module does not require any extra steps. Simply using the configure flag [`--with-user-crypto`](chapter02.md#--with-user-crypto) will map all function calls from the typical wolfSSL crypto to the user crypto module.

Memory allocations, if using wolfSSL’s XMALLOC, should be tagged with `DYNAMIC_TYPE_USER_CRYPTO`. Allowing for analyzing memory allocations used by the module.

User crypto modules **cannot** be used in conjunction with the wolfSSL configure options fast-rsa and/or fips. Fips requires that specific, certified code be used and fast-rsa makes use of the example user crypto module to perform RSA operations.

## Timing-Resistance in wolfSSL

wolfSSL provides the function “ConstantCompare” which guarantees constant time when doing comparison operations that could potentially leak timing information. This API is used at both the TLS and crypto level in wolfSSL to deter against timing based, side-channel attacks.

The wolfSSL ECC implementation has the define `ECC_TIMING_RESISTANT` to enable timing-resistance in the ECC algorithm. Similarly the define `TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT` is provided in the fast math libraries for RSA algorithm timing-resistance. The function exptmod uses the timing resistant Montgomery ladder.

See also: [`--disable-harden`](chapter02.md#--disable-harden)

Timing resistance and cache resistance defines enabled with `--enable-harden`:

* DEPRECATED: `WOLFSSL_SP_CACHE_RESISTANT`: Always on by default, see [`--disable-harden`](chapter02.md#--disable-harden) to disable default cache resistance.
* `WC_RSA_BLINDING`: Enables blinding mode, to prevent timing attacks.
* `ECC_TIMING_RESISTANT`: ECC specific timing resistance.
* `TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT`: Fast math specific timing resistance.
