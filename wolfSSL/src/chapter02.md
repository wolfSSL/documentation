# Building wolfSSL

wolfSSL was written with portability in mind and should generally be easy to build on most systems. If you have difficulty building wolfSSL, please don’t hesitate to seek support through our support forums (<https://www.wolfssl.com/forums>) or contact us directly at [support@wolfssl.com](mailto:support@wolfssl.com).

This chapter explains how to build wolfSSL on Unix and Windows, and provides guidance for building wolfSSL in a non-standard environment. You will find the “getting started” guide in [Chapter 3](chapter03.md#getting-started) and an SSL tutorial in [Chapter 11](chapter11.md#ssl-tutorial).

When using the autoconf / automake system to build wolfSSL, wolfSSL uses a single Makefile to build all parts and examples of the library, which is both simpler and faster than using Makefiles recursively.

## Getting wolfSSL Source Code

The most recent version of wolfSSL can be downloaded from the wolfSSL website as a ZIP file:

<https://www.wolfssl.com/download>

After downloading the ZIP file, unzip the file using the `unzip` command. To use native line endings, enable the `-a` modifier when using unzip. From the unzip man page, the `-a` modifier functionality is described:

> [...] The -a option causes files identified by zip as text files (those with
> the ‘t’ label in zipinfo listings, rather than ‘b’) to be automatically
> extracted as such, converting line endings, end-of-file characters
> and the character set itself as necessary. [...]

**NOTE**: Beginning with the release of wolfSSL 2.0.0rc3, the directory structure of wolfSSL was changed as well as the standard install location. These changes were made to make it easier for open source projects to integrate wolfSSL. For more information on header and structure changes, please see [Library Headers](chapter09.md#library-headers) and [Structure Usage](#structure-usage).

## Building on \*nix

When building wolfSSL on Linux, \*BSD, OS X, Solaris, or other \*nix-like systems, use the autoconf system. To build wolfSSL you only need to run two commands from the wolfSSL root directory, `./configure` and `make`.

The `./configure` script sets up the build environment and you cab append any number of build options to `./configure`. For a list of available build options, please see [Build Options](#build-options) or run the following the command line to see a list of possible options to pass to the `./configure` script:

```sh
./configure --help
```

Once `./configure` has successfully executed, to build wolfSSL, run:

```sh
make
```

To install wolfSSL run:

```sh
make install
```

You may need superuser privileges to install, in which case precede the command with sudo:

```sh
sudo make install
```

To test the build, run the testsuite program from the root wolfSSL directory:

```sh
./testsuite/testsuite.test
```

Alternatively you can use autoconf to run the testsuite as well as the standard wolfSSL API and crypto tests:

```sh
make test
```

Further details about expected output of the testsuite program can be found in the [Testsuite section](chapter03.md#testsuite). If you want to build only the wolfSSL library and not the additional items (examples, testsuite, benchmark app, etc.), you can run the following command fromthe wolfSSL root directory:

```sh
make src/libwolfssl.la
```

## Building on Windows

In addition to the instructions below, you can find instructions and tips for building wolfSSL with Visual Studio [here](https://wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/Docs-wolfssl-visual-studio.html).

### VS 2008

Solutions are included for Visual Studio 2008 in the root directory of the install. For use with Visual Studio 2010 and later, the existing project files should be able to be converted during the import process.

**Note**:
If importing to a newer version of VS you will be asked: “Do you want to overwrite the project and its imported property sheets?” You can avoid the following by selecting “No”. Otherwise if you select “Yes”, you will see warnings about `EDITANDCONTINUE` being ignored due to `SAFESEH` specification. You will need to right click on the testsuite, sslSniffer, server, echoserver, echoclient, and client individually and modify their Properties-\>Configuration Properties-\>Linker-\>Advanced (scroll all the way to the bottom in Advanced window). Locate “Image Has Safe Exception Handlers” and click the drop down arrow on the far right. Change this to No (`/SAFESEH:NO`) for each of the aforementioned. The other option is to disable `EDITANDCONTINUE` which, we have found to be useful for debugging purposes and is therefore not recommended.

### VS 2010

You will need to download Service Pack 1 to build wolfSSL solution once it has been updated. If VS reports a linker error, clean and rebuild the project; the linker error should be taken care of.

### VS 2013 (64 bit solution)

You will need to download Service Pack 4 to build wolfSSL solution once it has been updated. If VS reports a linker error, clean the project then Rebuild the project and the linker error should be taken care of.

To test each build, choose “Build All” from the Visual Studio menu and then run the testsuite program. To edit build options in the Visual Studio project, select your desired project (wolfssl, echoclient, echoserver, etc.) and browse to the “Properties” panel.

**Note**: After the wolfSSL v3.8.0 release the build preprocessor macros were moved to a centralized file located at `IDE/WIN/user_settings.h`. This file can also be found in the project. To add features such as ECC or ChaCha20/Poly1305 add `#defines` here such as `HAVE_ECC` or `HAVE_CHACHA` / `HAVE_POLY1305`.

### Cygwin

If building wolfSSL for Windows on a Windows development machine, we recommend using the included Visual Studio project files to build wolfSSL. However if Cygwin is required here is a short guide on how our team achieved a successful build:

1. Go to <https://www.cygwin.com/install.html> and download `setup-x86_64.exe`
2. Run `setup-x86_64.exe` and install however you choose. Click through the installation menus until you reach the "Select Packages" stage.
3. Click on the "+" icon to expand "All"
4. Now go to the "Archive" section and select "unzip" drop down, change "Skip" to 6.0-15 (or some other version).
5. Under "Devel" click "autoconf" drop down and change "Skip" to "10-1" (or some other version)
6. Under "Devel" click "automake" drop down and change "Skip" to "10-1" (or some other version)
7. Under "Devel" click the "gcc-core" drop down and change "Skip" to 7.4.0-1 (NOTE: wolfSSL has not tested GCC 9 or 10 and as they are fairly new does not recommend using them until they have had a bit more time to be fine-tuned for development).
8. Under "Devel" click the "git" drop down and change "Skip" to 2.29.0-1 (or some other version)
9. Under "Devel" click "libtool" drop down and change "Skip" to "2.4.6-5" (or some other version)
10. Under "Devel" click the "make" drop down and change "Skip" to 4.2.1-1 (or some other version)
11. Click "Next" and proceed through the rest of the installation.

The additional packages list should include:

* unzip
* autoconf
* automake
* gcc-core
* git
* libtool
* make

#### Post Install

Open a Cygwin terminal and clone wolfSSL:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl.git
cd wolfssl
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check
```

## Building in a non-standard environment

While not officially supported, we try to help users wishing to build wolfSSL in a non-standard environment, particularly with embedded and cross-compilation systems. Below are some notes on getting started with this.

1. The source and header files need to remain in the same directory structure as they are in the wolfSSL download package.
2. Some build systems will want to explicitly know where the wolfSSL header files are located, so you may need to specify that. They are located in the `<wolfssl_root>/wolfssl` directory. Typically, you can add the `<wolfssl_root>` directory to your include path to resolve header problems.
3. wolfSSL defaults to a little endian system unless the configure process detects big endian. Since users building in a non-standard environment aren't using the configure process, `BIG_ENDIAN_ORDER` will need to be defined if using a big endian system.
4. wolfSSL benefits speed-wise from having a 64-bit type available. The configure process determines if long or long long is 64 bits and if so sets up a define. So if `sizeof(long)` is 8 bytes on your system, define `SIZEOF_LONG 8`. If it isn't but `sizeof(long long)` is 8 bytes, then define `SIZEOF_LONG_LONG 8`.
5. Try to build the library, and let us know if you run into any problems. If you need help, contact us at [info@wolfssl.com](mailto:info@wolfssl.com).
6. Some defines that can modify the build are listed in the following sub-sections, below. For more verbose descriptions of many options, please see [Build Options](#build-options).

### Building into Yocto Linux

wolfSSL also includes recipes for building wolfSSL on Yocto Linux and OpenEmbedded. These recipes are maintained within the meta-wolfSSL layer as a GitHub repository, here: <https://github.com/wolfSSL/meta-wolfssl>. Building wolfSSL on Yocto Linux will require Git and bitbake. The following steps list how to get some wolfSSL products (that recipes exist for) built on Yocto Linux.

1. **Cloning wolfSSL meta**

    This can be done through a git-clone command of the following URL:
    <https://github.com/wolfSSL/meta-wolfssl>

2. **Insert the "meta-wolfSSL" layer into the build's bblayers.conf**

    Within the `BBLAYERS` section, add the path to the location where meta-wolfssl
    was cloned into. Example:

    ```sh
    BBLAYERS ?= "... \
    /path/to/meta-wolfssl/ \
    ..."
    ```

3. **Build a wolfSSL product recipe**

    bitbake can be used to build one of the three following wolfSSL product recipes:
    *wolfssl*, *wolfssh*, and *wolfmqtt*. Simply pass one of those recipes into the bitbake
    command (example: `bitbake wolfssl`). This allows the user to personally
    confirm compilation succeeds without issues.

4. **Edit local.conf**

    The final step is to edit the build's local.conf file, which allows desired libraries to
    be included with the image being built. Edit the `IMAGE_INSTALL_append` line
    to include the name of the desired recipe(s). An example of this is shown below:

    ```sh
    IMAGE_INSTALL_apped = "wolfssl wolfssh wolfmqtt"
    ```

Once the image has been built, wolfSSL's default location (or related products from recipes) will be the `/usr/lib/` directory.

Additionally, wolfSSL can be customized when building into Yocto by using the enable and disable options listed in [Build Options](#build-options). This requires creating a `.bbappend` file and placing it within the wolfSSL application/recipe layer. The contents of this file should include a line specifying content to concatenate onto the `EXTRA_OECONF` variable. An example of this is shown below to enable TLS 1.3 support through the TLS 1.3 enable option:

```sh
EXTRA_OECONF += "--enable-tls13"
```

Further documentation on building into Yocto can be found in the meta-wolfssl README, located here: <https://github.com/wolfSSL/meta-wolfssl/blob/master/README.md>

### Building with Atollic TrueSTUDIO

Versions of wolfSSL following 3.15.5 include a TrueSTUDIO project file that is used to build wolfSSL on ARM M4-Cortex devices. The TrueSTUDIO project file simplifies the process of building on STM32 devices, is free to download, and is createed by Atollic - a part of ST Microelectronics. To build the wolfSSL static library project file in TrueSTUDIO, it will require the user perform the following steps after opening TrueSTUDIO:

1. Import the project into the workspace (File > Import)
2. Build the project (Project > Build project)

The build then includes the settings located inside of `user_settings.h` at build-time. The default content of the `user_settings.h` file is minimal, and does not contain many features. Users are able to modify this file and add or remove features with options listed in the remainder of this chapter.

### Building with IAR

The `<wolfssl_root>/IDE/IAR-EWARM` directory contains the following files:

1. Workspace: `wolfssl.eww`
   The workspace includes wolfSSL-Lib library and wolfCrypt-test, wolfCrypt-benchmark
   executable projects.
2. wolfSSL-Lib Project: `lib/wolfSSL-lib.ewp`
   generates full set library of wolfCrypt and wolfSSL functions.
3. Test suites Project: `test/wolfCrypt-test.ewp`
   generates test.out test suites executable
4. Benchmark Project: `benchmark/wolfCrypt-benchmark.ewp`
   generates benchmark.out benchmark executable

These projects have been set up to generic ARM Cortex-M MPUs. In order to generate project for specific target MPU, take following steps.

0. Default Setting: Default Target of the projects are set to Cortex-M3 Simulator. user_settings.h includes default options for the projects. You can build and 
download the to the simulator. Open Terminal I/O window, by "view"->"Terminal I/O", and start execution.

1. Project option settings: For each project, choose appropriate "Target" options.

2. For executable projects: Add "SystemInit" and "startup" for your MPU, choose your debug "Driver".

3. For benchmark project: Choose option for current_time function or write your own "current_time" benchmark timer with WOLFSSL_USER_CURRTIME option.

4. Build and download: Go to "Project->Make" and "Download and Debug" in Menu bar for EWARM build and download.

### Building on OS X and iOS 

#### XCODE

The `<wolfssl_root>/IDE/XCODE` directory contains the following files:

1. `wolfssl.xcworkspace` -- workspace with library and testsuite client
2. `wolfssl_testsuite.xcodeproj` -- project to run the testsuite.
3. `wolfssl.xcodeproj` -- project to build OS/x and iOS libraries for wolfSSL and/or wolfCrypt
4. `wolfssl-FIPS.xcodeproj` -- project to build wolfSSL and wolfCrypt-FIPS if available
5. `user_settings.h` -- custom library settings, which are shared across projects

The library will output as `libwolfssl_osx.a` or `libwolfssl_ios.a` depending on the target. It will also copy the wolfSSL/wolfCrypt (and the CyaSSL/CtaoCrypt 
compatibility) headers into an `include` directory located in 
`Build/Products/Debug` or `Build/Products/Release`.

For the library and testsuite to link properly the build location needs to be configured as realitive to workspace.
1. File -> Workspace Settings (or Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations -> Locations)
2. Derived Data -> Advanced
3. Custom -> Relative to Workspace
4. Products -> Build/Products

These Xcode projects define the `WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS` preprocessor to enable the `user_settings.h` file for setting macros across multiple projects.

If needed the Xcode preprocessors can be modified with these steps:
1. Click on the Project in "Project Navigator".
2. Click on the "Build Settings" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "Apple LLVM 6.0 - Preprocessing" section.
4. Open the disclosure for "Preprocessor Macros" and use the "+" and 
"-" buttons to modify. Remember to do this for both Debug and Release.

This project should build wolfSSL and wolfCrypt using the default settings.

### Building with GCC ARM

In the `<wolfssl_root>/IDE/GCC-ARM` directory, you will find an example wolfSSL project for Cortex M series, but it can be adopted for other architectures.

1. Make sure you have `gcc-arm-none-eabi` installed.
2. Modify the `Makefile.common`:
  * Use correct toolchain path `TOOLCHAIN`.
  * Use correct architecture 'ARCHFLAGS'. See [GCC ARM Options](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.3/gcc/ARM-Options.html) `-mcpu=name`.
  * Confirm memory map in linker.ld matches your flash/ram or comment out `SRC_LD = -T./linker.ld` in Makefile.common.
3. Use `make` to build the static library (libwolfssl.a), wolfCrypt test/benchmark and wolfSSL TLS client targets as `.elf` and `.hex` in `/Build`.


#### Building with generic makefile cross-compile

Example `Makefile.common` changes for Raspberry Pi with Cortex-A53:

1. In Makefile.common change `ARCHFLAGS` to `-mcpu=cortex-a53 -mthumb`.
2. Comment out `SRC_LD`, since custom memory map is not applicable.
3. Clear `TOOLCHAIN`, so it will use default `gcc`. Set `TOOLCHAIN = `
4. Comment out `LDFLAGS += --specs=nano.specs` and `LDFLAGS += --specs=nosys.specs` to nosys and nano.

#### Building with configure with cross-compile

The configure script in the main project directory can perform a cross-compile
build with the the gcc-arm-none-eabi tools. Assuming the tools are installed in
your executable path:

```sh
./configure \
  --host=arm-non-eabi \
  CC=arm-none-eabi-gcc \
  AR=arm-none-eabi-ar \
  STRIP=arm-none-eabi-strip \
  RANLIB=arm-none-eabi-ranlib \
  --prefix=/path/to/build/wolfssl-arm \
  CFLAGS="-march=armv8-a --specs=nosys.specs \
      -DHAVE_PK_CALLBACKS -DWOLFSSL_USER_IO -DNO_WRITEV" \
  --disable-filesystem --enable-fastmath \
  --disable-shared
make
make install
```

If you are building for a 32-bit architecture, add `-DTIME_T_NOT_64BIT` to the
list of CFLAGS.

### Building on Keil MDK-ARM

You can find detailed instructions and tips for building wolfSSL on Keil MDK-ARM [here](https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/keil-mdk-arm/).

**Note**: If MDK-ARM is not installed in the default installation location, you need to change all of the referencing path definitions in the project file to the 
install location.

## Features Defined as C Pre-processor Macro

### Removing Features

The following defines can be used to remove features from wolfSSL. This can be helpful if you are trying to reduce the overall library footprint size. In addition to defining a `NO_<feature-name>` define, you can also remove the respective source file as well from the build (but not the header file).

#### NO_WOLFSSL_CLIENT

Removes calls specific to the client and is for a server-only builds. You should only use this if you want to remove a few calls for the sake of size.

#### NO_WOLFSSL_SERVER

Likewise removes calls specific to the server side.

#### NO_DES3

Removes the use of DES3 encryptions. DES3 is built-in by default because some older servers still use it and it's required by SSL 3.0. `NO_DH` and `NO_AES` are the same as the two above, they are widely used.

#### NO_DSA

Removes DSA since it's being phased out of popular use.

#### NO_ERROR_STRINGS

Disables error strings. Error strings are located in `src/internal.c` for wolfSSL or `wolfcrypt/src/asn.c` for wolfCrypt.

#### NO_HMAC

Removes HMAC from the build.

**NOTE**: SSL/TLS depends on HMAC but if you are only using wolfCrypt IE build option `WOLFCRYPT_ONLY` then HMAC can be disabled in this case.

#### NO_MD4

Removes MD4 from the build, MD4 is broken and shouldn't be used.

#### NO_MD5

Removes MD5 from the build.

#### NO_SHA

Removes SHA-1 from the build.

#### NO_SHA256

Removes SHA-256 from the build.

#### NO_PSK

Turns off the use of the pre-shared key extension. It is built-in by default.

#### NO_PWDBASED

Disables password-based key derivation functions such as PBKDF1, PBKDF2, and PBKDF from PKCS #12.

#### NO_RC4

Removes the use of the ARC4 stream cipher from the build. ARC4 is built-in by default because it is still popular and widely used.

#### NO_RABBIT and NO_HC128

Remove stream cipher extensions from the build.

#### NO_SESSION_CACHE

Can be defined when a session cache is not needed. This should reduce memory use by nearly 3 kB.

#### NO_TLS

Turns off TLS. We don’t recommend turning off TLS.

#### SMALL_SESSION_CACHE

Can be defined to limit the size of the SSL session cache used by wolfSSL. This will reduce the default session cache from 33 sessions to 6 sessions and save approximately 2.5 kB.

#### NO_RSA

Removes support for the RSA algorithm.

#### WC_NO_RSA_OAEP

Removes code for OAEP padding.

#### NO_AES_CBC

Turns off AES-CBC algorithm support.

#### NO_DEV_URANDOM

Disables the use of `/dev/urandom`

#### WOLFSSL_NO_SIGALG

Disables the signature algorithms extension

#### NO_RESUME_SUITE_CHECK

Disables the check of cipher suite when resuming a TLS connection

#### NO_ASN

Removes support for ASN formatted certificate processing.

#### NO_OLD_TLS

Removes support for SSLv3, TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1

#### WOLFSSL_AEAD_ONLY

Removes support for non-AEAD algorithms. AEAD stands for “authenticated encryption with associated data” which means these algorithms (such as AES-GCM) do not just encrypt and decrypt data, they also assure confidentiality and authenticity of that data.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_NO_2048

Removes RSA/DH 2048-bit Single-Precision (SP) optimization.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_NO_3072

Removes RSA/DH 3072-bit Single-Precision (SP) optimization.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_NO_256

Removes ECC Single-Precision (SP) optimization for SECP256R1. Only applies to `WOLFSSL_SP_MATH`.

### Enabling Features Disabled by Default

#### WOLFSSL_CERT_GEN

Turns on wolfSSL’s certificate generation functionality. See [Keys and Certificates](chapter07.md#keys-and-certificates) for more information.

#### WOLFSSL_DER_LOAD

Allows loading DER-formatted CA certs into the wolfSSL context (`WOLFSSL_CTX`) using the function [`wolfSSL_CTX_der_load_verify_locations()`](group__CertsKeys.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_der_load_verify_locations).

#### WOLFSSL_DTLS

Turns on the use of DTLS, or datagram TLS. This isn't widely supported or used.

#### WOLFSSL_KEY_GEN

Turns on wolfSSL’s RSA key generation functionality. See [Keys and Certificates](chapter07.md#keys-and-certificates) for more information.

#### WOLFSSL_RIPEMD

Enables RIPEMD-160 support.

#### WOLFSSL_SHA384

Enables SHA-384 support.

#### WOLFSSL_SHA512

Enables SHA-512 support.

#### DEBUG_WOLFSSL

Builds in the ability to debug. For more information regarding debugging wolfSSL, see [Debugging](chapter08.md#debugging).

#### HAVE_AESCCM

Enables AES-CCM support.

#### HAVE_AESGCM

Enables AES-GCM support.

#### WOLFSSL_AES_XTS

Enables AES-XTS support.

#### HAVE_CAMELLIA

Enables Camellia support.

#### HAVE_CHACHA

Enables ChaCha20 support.

#### HAVE_POLY1305

Enables Poly1305 support.

#### HAVE_CRL

Enables Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support.

#### HAVE_CRL_IO

Enables blocking inline HTTP request on the CRL URL. It will load the CRL into the `WOLFSSL_CTX` and apply it to all WOLFSSL objects created from it.

#### HAVE_ECC

Enables Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) support.

#### HAVE_LIBZ

Is an extension that can allow for compression of data over the connection. It normally shouldn't be used, see the note below under configure notes libz.

#### HAVE_OCSP

Enables Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) support.

#### OPENSSL_EXTRA

Builds even more OpenSSL compatibility into the library, and enables the wolfSSL OpenSSL compatibility layer to ease porting wolfSSL into existing applications which had been designed to work with OpenSSL. It is off by default.

#### TEST_IPV6

Turns on testing of IPv6 in the test applications. wolfSSL proper is IP neutral, but the testing applications use IPv4 by default.

#### HAVE_CSHARP

Turns on configuration options needed for C# wrapper.

#### HAVE_CURVE25519

Turns on the use of curve25519 algorithm.

#### HAVE_ED25519

Turns on use of the ed25519 algorithm.

#### WOLFSSL_DH_CONST

Turns off use of floating point values when performing Diffie Hellman operations and uses tables for `XPOW()` and `XLOG()`. Removes dependency on external math library.

#### WOLFSSL_TRUST_PEER_CERT

Turns on the use of trusted peer certificates. This allows for loading in a peer certificate to match with a connection rather than using a CA. When turned on if a trusted peer certificate is matched than the peer cert chain is not loaded and the peer is considered verified. Using CAs is preferred.

#### WOLFSSL_STATIC_MEMORY

Turns on the use of static memory buffers and functions. This allows for using static memory instead of dynamic.

#### WOLFSSL_SESSION_EXPORT

Turns on the use of DTLS session export and import. This allows for serializing and sending/receiving the current state of a DTLS session.

#### WOLFSSL_ARMASM

Turns on the use of ARMv8 hardware acceleration.

#### WC_RSA_NONBLOCK

Turns on fast math RSA non-blocking support for splitting RSA operations into smaller chunks of work. Feature is enabled by calling [`wc_RsaSetNonBlock()`](group__RSA.md#function-wc_rsasetnonblock) and checking for `FP_WOULDBLOCK` return code.

#### WOLFSSL_RSA_VERIFY_ONLY

Turns on small build for RSA verify only use. Should be used with the macros [`WOLFSSL_RSA_PUBLIC_ONLY`](#wolfssl_rsa_public_only), [`WOLFSSL_RSA_VERIFY_INLINE`](#wolfssl_rsa_verify_inline), [`NO_SIG_WRAPPER`](#no_sig_wrapper), and [`WOLFCRYPT_ONLY`](#wolfcrypt_only).

#### WOLFSSL_RSA_PUBLIC_ONLY

Turns on small build for RSA public key only use. Should be used with the macro [`WOLFCRYPT_ONLY`](#wolfcrypt_only).

#### WOLFSSL_SHA3

Turns on build for SHA3 use. This is support for SHA3 Keccak for the sizes SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384 and SHA3-512. In addition `WOLFSSL_SHA3_SMALL` can be used to trade off performance for resource use.

#### USE_ECDSA_KEYSZ_HASH_ALGO

Will choose a hash algorithm that matches the ephemeral ECDHE key size or the next highest available. This workaround resolves issues with some peers that do not properly support scenarios such as a P-256 key hashed with SHA512.

#### WOLFSSL_ALT_CERT_CHAIN

Allows CA's to be presented by peer, but not part of a valid chain. Default wolfSSL behavior is to require validation of all presented peer certificates. This also allows loading intermediate CA's as trusted and ignoring no signer failures for CA's up the chain to root. The alternate certificate chain mode only requires that the peer certificate validate to a trusted CA.

#### WOLFSSL_CUSTOM_CURVES

Allow non-standard curves. Includes the curve "a" variable in calculation. Additional curve types can be enabled using [`HAVE_ECC_SECPR2`](#have_ecc_secpr2), [`HAVE_ECC_SECPR3`](#have_ecc_secpr3), [`HAVE_ECC_BRAINPOOL`](#have_ecc_brainpool) and [`HAVE_ECC_KOBLITZ`](#have_ecc_koblitz).

#### HAVE_COMP_KEY

Enables ECC compressed key support.

#### WOLFSSL_EXTRA_ALERTS

Enables additional alerts to be sent during a TLS connection. This feature is also enabled automatically when [`--enable-opensslextra`](#enable-opensslextra) is used.

#### WOLFSSL_DEBUG_TLS

Enables additional debugging print outs during a TLS connection

#### HAVE_BLAKE2

Enables Blake2s algorithm support

#### HAVE_FALLBACK_SCSV

Enables Signaling Cipher Suite Value(SCSV) support on the server side. This handles the cipher suite 0x56 0x00 sent from a client to signal that no downgrade of TLS version should be allowed.

#### WOLFSSL_PSK_ONE_ID

Enables support for only one PSK ID with TLS 1.3.

#### SHA256_MANY_REGISTERS

A SHA256 version that keeps all data in registers and partially unrolls loops.

#### WOLFCRYPT_HAVE_SRP

Enables wolfcrypt secure remote password support

#### WOLFSSL_MAX_STRENGTH

Enables the strongest security features only and disables any weak or deprecated features. Results in slower performance due to near constant time execution to protect against timing based side-channel attacks.

#### WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA

Static ciphers are strongly discouraged and should never be used if avoidable. However there are still legacy systems that ONLY support static cipher suites. To that end if you need to connect to a legacy peer only supporting static RSA cipher suites use this to enable support for static RSA in wolfSSL. (See also [`WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK`](#wolfssl_static_psk) and [`WOLFSSL_STATIC_DH`](#wolfssl_static_dh))

#### WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK

Static ciphers are highly discouraged see [`WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA`](#wolfssl_static_rsa)

#### WOLFSSL_STATIC_DH

Static ciphers are highly discouraged see [`WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA`](#wolfssl_static_rsa)

#### HAVE_NULL_CIPHER

Turns on support for NULL ciphers. This option is highly discouraged from a security standpoint however some systems are too small to perform encrypt/decrypt operations and it is better to at least authenticate messages and peers to prevent message tampering than nothing at all!

#### HAVE_ANON

Turns on support for anonymous cipher suites. (Never recommended, some valid use cases involving closed or private networks detached from the web)

#### HAVE_LIBOQS

Turn on support for the OpenQuantumSafe team's liboqs integration. Please see the appendix "Experimenting with Quantum-Safe Cryptography" in this document for more details.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_4096

Enable RSA/DH 4096-bit Single-Precision (SP) support.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_384

Enable ECC SECP384R1 Single-Precision (SP) support. Only applies to `WOLFSSL_SP_MATH`.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_1024

Enable SAKKE pairing based cryptography Single-Precision (SP) support.

### Customizing or Porting wolfSSL

#### WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS

If defined allows a user specific settings file to be used. The file must be named `user_settings.h` and exist in the include path. This is included prior to the standard `settings.h` file, so default settings can be overridden.

#### WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS

Is an extension that allows debugging callbacks through the use of signals in an environment without a debugger, it is off by default. It can also be used to set up a timer with blocking sockets. Please see [Callbacks](chapter06.md#callbacks) for more information.

#### WOLFSSL_USER_IO

Allows the user to remove automatic setting of the default I/O functions [`EmbedSend()`](wolfio_8h.md#function-embedsend) and [`EmbedReceive()`](wolfio_8h.md#function-embedrecieve). Used for custom I/O abstraction layer (see [Abstraction Layers](chapter05.md#abstraction-layers) for more details).

#### NO_FILESYSTEM

Is used if stdio isn't available to load certificates and key files. This enables the use of buffer extensions to be used instead of the file ones.

#### NO_INLINE

Disables the automatic inlining of small, heavily used functions. Turning this on will slow down wolfSSL and actually make it bigger since these are small functions, usually much smaller than function call setup/return. You’ll also need to add `wolfcrypt/src/misc.c` to the list of compiled files if you’re not using autoconf.

#### NO_DEV_RANDOM

Disables the use of the default `/dev/random` random number generator. If defined, the user needs to write an OS-specific `GenerateSeed()` function (found in `wolfcrypt/src/random.c`).

#### NO_MAIN_DRIVER

Is used in the normal build environment to determine whether a test application is called on its own or through the testsuite driver application. You'll only need to use it with the test files: `test.c`, `client.c`, `server.c`, `echoclient.c`, `echoserver.c`, and `testsuite.c`

#### NO_WRITEV

Disables simulation of `writev()` semantics.

#### SINGLE_THREADED

Is a switch that turns off the use of mutexes. wolfSSL currently only uses one for the session cache. If your use of wolfSSL is always single threaded you can turn this on.

#### USER_TICKS

Allows the user to define their own clock tick function if time(0) is not wanted. Custom function needs second accuracy, but doesn’t have to be correlated to Epoch. See `LowResTimer()` function in `wolfssl_int.c`.

#### USER_TIME

Disables the use of time.h structures in the case that the user wants (or needs) to use their own. See `wolfcrypt/src/asn.c` for implementation details. The user will need to define and/or implement `XTIME()`, `XGMTIME()`, and `XVALIDATE_DATE()`.

#### USE_CERT_BUFFERS_1024

Enables 1024-bit test certificate and key buffers located in `<wolfssl_root>/wolfssl/certs_test.h`. Helpful when testing on and porting to embedded systems with no filesystem.

#### USE_CERT_BUFFERS_2048

Enables 2048-bit test certificate and key buffers located in `<wolfssl_root>/wolfssl/certs_test.h`. Helpful when testing on and porting to embedded systems with no filesystem.

#### CUSTOM_RAND_GENERATE_SEED

Allows user to define custom function equivalent to `wc_GenerateSeed(byte* output, word32 sz)`.

#### CUSTOM_RAND_GENERATE_BLOCK

Allows user to define custom random number generation function. Examples of use are as follows.

```sh
./configure --disable-hashdrbg
CFLAGS="-DCUSTOM_RAND_GENERATE_BLOCK= custom_rand_generate_block"
```

Or

```c
/* RNG */
/* #define HAVE_HASHDRBG */
extern int custom_rand_generate_block(unsigned char* output, unsigned int sz);
```

#### NO_PUBLIC_GCM_SET_IV

Use this if you have done your own custom hardware port and not provided a public implementation of [`wc_AesGcmSetIV()`](group__AES.md#function-wc_aesgcmsetiv)

#### NO_PUBLIC_CCM_SET_NONCE

Use this if you have done your own custom hardware port and not provided a public implementation of `wc_AesGcmSetNonce()`

#### NO_GCM_ENCRYPT_EXTRA

Use this if you have done your own custom hardwareport and not provided an implementation of `wc_AesGcmEncrypt_ex()`

#### WOLFSSL_STM32[F1 | F2 | F4 | F7 | L4]

Use one of these defines when building for the appropriate STM32 device. Update `wolfssl-root/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h` section with regards to the wolfSSL porting guide (<https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/porting-guide/>) as appropriate.

#### WOLFSSL_STM32_CUBEMX

When using the CubeMX tool to generate Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) API’s use this setting to add appropriate support in wolfSSL.

#### WOLFSSL_CUBEMX_USE_LL

When using the CubeMX tool to generate APIs there are two options, HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) or Low Layer (LL). Use this define to control which headers are include in `wolfssl-root/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h` in the `WOLFSSL_STM32[F1/F2/F4/F7/L4]` section.

#### NO_STM32_CRYPTO

For when an STM32 part does not offer hardware crypto support

#### NO_STM32_HASH

For when an STM32 part does not offer hardware hash support

#### NO_STM32_RNG

For when an STM32 part does not offer hardware RNG support

#### XTIME_MS

Macro to map a function for use to get the time in milliseconds when using TLS 1.3. Example being:

```c
extern time_t m2mb_xtime_ms(time_t * timer);
#define XTIME_MS(tl) m2mb_xtime_ms((tl))
```

### Reducing Memory or Code Usage

#### TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT

Can be defined when using fast math ([`USE_FAST_MATH`](#use_fast_math)) on systems with a small stack size. This will get rid of the large static arrays.

#### WOLFSSL_SMALL_STACK

Can be used for devices which have a small stack size. This increases the use of dynamic memory in `wolfcrypt/src/integer.c`, but can lead to slower performance.

#### ALT_ECC_SIZE

If using fast math and RSA/DH you can define this to reduce your ECC memory consumption. Instead of using stack for ECC points it will allocate from the heap.

#### ECC_SHAMIR

Uses variation of ECC math that is slightly faster, but doubles heap usage.

#### RSA_LOW_MEM

When defined CRT is not used which saves on some memory but slows down RSA operations. It is off by default.

#### WOLFSSL_SHA3_SMALL

When SHA3 is enabled this macro will reduce build size.

#### WOLFSSL_SMALL_CERT_VERIFY

Verify the certificate signature without using DecodedCert. Doubles up on some code but allows smaller peak heap memory usage. Cannot be used with [`WOLFSSL_NONBLOCK_OCSP`](#wolfssl_nonblock_ocsp).

#### GCM_SMALL

Option to reduce AES GCM code size by calculating at runtime instead of using tables. Possible options are: `GCM_SMALL`, `GCM_WORD32` or `GCM_TABLE`.

#### CURVED25519_SMALL

Defines [`CURVE25519_SMALL`](#curve25519_small) and [`ED25519_SMALL`](#ed25519_small).

#### CURVE25519_SMALL

Use small memory option for curve25519. This uses less memory, but is slower.

#### ED25519_SMALL

Use small memory option for ed25519. This uses less memory, but is slower.

#### USE_SLOW_SHA

Reduces code size by not unrolling loops, which reduces performance for SHA.

#### USE_SLOW_SHA256

Reduces code size by not unrolling loops, which reduces performance for SHA. About 2k smaller and about 25% slower.

#### USE_SLOW_SHA512

Reduces code size by not unrolling loops, which reduces performance for SHA. Over twice as small, but 50% slower.

#### ECC_USER_CURVES

Allow user to choose ECC curve sizes that are enabled. Only the 256-bit curve is enabled by default. To enable others use `HAVE_ECC192`, `HAVE_ECC224`, etc...

#### WOLFSSL_SP_NO_MALLOC

In the SP code, always use stack, no heap XMALLOC()/XREALLOC()/XFREE() calls are made.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_NO_DYN_STACK

Disable use of dynamic stack items. Used with small code size and not small stack.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_FAST_MODEXP

Compiles in a faster mod_exp implementation at the expense of code size.

#### WC_DISABLE_RADIX_ZERO_PAD

Disable printing of leading zero in hexidecimal string output. For example, if this macro is defined, the value 8 will be printed as the string "0x8" but if it is not defined it will be printed as "0x08". Defining this macro can reduce code size.

### Increasing Performance

#### USE_INTEL_SPEEDUP

Enables use of Intel’s AVX/AVX2 instructions for accelerating AES, ChaCha20, Poly1305, SHA256, SHA512, ED25519 and Curve25519.

#### WOLFSSL_AESNI

Enables use of AES accelerated operations which are built into some Intel and AMD chipsets. When using this define, the `aes_asm.asm` (for Windows with at&t syntax) or `aes_asm.S` file is used to optimize via the Intel AES new instruction set (AESNI).

#### HAVE_INTEL_RDSEED

Enable Intel’s RDSEED for DRBG seed source.

#### HAVE_INTEL_RDRAND

Enable Intel’s RDRAND instruction for wolfSSL’s random source.

#### FP_ECC

Enables ECC Fixed Point Cache, which speeds up repeated operations against same private key. Can also define number of entries and LUT bits using `FP_ENTRIES` and `FP_LUT` to reduce default static memory usage.

#### WOLFSSL_ASYNC_CRYPT

This enables support for asynchronous cryptography using hardware based adapters such as the Intel QuickAssist or Marvell (Cavium) Nitrox V. The asynchronous code is not included in the public distribution and is available for evaluation by contacting us via email at facts@wolfssl.com.

### GCM Performance Tuning

There are 4 variants of GCM performance:

* `GCM_SMALL` - Smallest footprint, slowest (FIPS validated)
* `GCM_WORD32` - Medium (FIPS validated)
* `GCM_TABLE` - Fast (FIPS validated)
* `GCM_TABLE_4BIT` - Fastest (Not yet FIPS validated, will be included in FIPS 140-3!)

### wolfSSL’s Math Options

There are three math libraries in wolfSSL.

- Big Integer
- Fast Math
- Single Precision Math

When building wolfSSL, only one of these must be used.

Big Integer Library is the most portable option as it is written in C without any assembly. As such it is not optimized for specific architectures. All math variables are instanciated on the heap; minimal stack usage. Unfortunately, Big Integer Library is not timing resistant.

Fast Math Library is a good option. It is implemented using both C and assembly. As such, it has optimizations for specific architectures. All math variables are instanciated on the stack; minimal heap usage. It can be made timing resistant if the `TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT` macro is defined. We have taken it through FIPS 140-2 and 140-3 certifications.

Single Precision (SP) Math Library is our recommended library. It is implemented using both C and assembly. As such, it has optimizations for specific architectures. All math variables are instanciated on the stack; minimal heap usage. It is always timing resistant. It is generally optimized for speed at the cost of code size, but is highly configurable to compile out unneeded code. We have taken it through DO-178C certifications.

#### Big Integer Math Library

Forked from public domain LibTomMath library. For more information about LibTomMath, please see https://www.libtom.net/LibTomMath/ . Please note that our fork is considerably more active and secure than the original public domain code.

If built without configuration nor modification to any macros, for example for an embedded target, the macros will use this implementation. This is generally the most portable and generally easiest to get going with. The negatives to the normal big integer library are that it is slower, it uses a lot of heap memory as all memory is allocated from the heap, requires an `XREALLOC()` implementation and is not timing resistant. The implementation can be found in `integer.c`.

#### Fast Math

##### USE_FAST_MATH

Forked from public domain LibTomFastMath library. For more information about LibTomFastMath, please see https://www.libtom.net/LibTomFastMath/ . Please note that our fork is considerably more active and secure than the original public domain code from LibTomFastMath. We have improved performance, security and code quality. Also we have taken the Fastmath code through  FIPS 140-2 and 140-3 certifications.

The Fastmath option switches to a faster big integer library that uses assembly if possible. The Fastmath option will speed up asymmetric private/public key operations like RSA, DH, and DSA. By default, wolfSSL's configure scripts are setup to use the Fastmath library for x86_64 and aarch architectures. This option switches the big integer library to a faster one that uses assembly if possible.  Assembly inclusion is dependent on compiler and processor combinations. Some combinations will need additional configure flags and some may not be possible. Help with optimizing Fastmath with new assembly routines is available on a consulting basis. Use of the assembly code is dependent on the compiler and processor used. See the Archetecture-Specific Optimizations.

For Fastmath, all memory is allocated on the stack. Because the stack memory usage can be larger when using Fastmath, we recommend defining [`TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT`](#tfm_timing_resistant) as well when using this option. The Fastmath code is timing resistant if TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT is defined. This will reduce some of the large math windows for constant time, which use less memory. This uses less stack because there are no shortcuts and therefore less branching during private key operations. This also makes the implementation more secure as timing attacks are a real threat and can give malicious third parties enough information to reproduce the private key.

On ia32, for example, all of the registers need to be available so high optimization and omitting the frame pointer needs to be taken care of. wolfSSL will add `-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer` to GCC for non debug builds. If you're using a different compiler you may need to add these manually to `CFLAGS` during configure.

OS X will also need `-mdynamic-no-pic` added to `CFLAGS`. In addition, if you're building in shared mode for ia32 on OS X you'll need to pass options to `LDFLAGS` as well:

```sh
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-read_only_relocs,warning"
```

This gives warnings for some symbols instead of errors.

Fastmath also changes the way dynamic and stack memory is used. The normal math library uses dynamic memory for big integers. Fastmath uses fixed size buffers that hold 4096 bit integers by default, allowing for 2048 bit by 2048 bit multiplications. If you need 4096 bit by 4096 bit multiplications then change `FP_MAX_BITS` in `wolfssl/wolfcrypt/tfm.h`. As `FP_MAX_BITS` is increased, this will also increase the runtime stack usage since the buffers used in the public key operations will now be larger. `FP_MAX_BITS` needs to be double the max key size. For example if your biggest key is 2048-bit, `FP_MAX_BITS` should be 4096 and if it is 4096-bit `FP_MAX_BITS` should be 8192. If using ECC only this can be reduced to the maximum ECC key size times two. A couple of functions in the library use several temporary big integers, meaning the stack can get relatively large. This should only come into play on embedded systems or in threaded environments where the stack size is set to a low value. If stack corruption occurs with Fastmath during public key operations in those environments, increase the stack size to accommodate the stack usage.

If you are enabling Fastmath without using the autoconf system, you’ll need to define `USE_FAST_MATH` and add `tfm.c` to the wolfSSL build while removing `integer.c`. Defining `ALT_ECC_SIZE` will allocate ECC points only from the heap instead of the stack.

The following are options which may be appended to the `./configure` script to customize how the wolfSSL library is built.

By default, wolfSSL only builds in shared mode, with static mode being disabled. This speeds up build times by a factor of two. Either mode can be explicitly disabled or enabled if desired.

### `--enable-debug`

Enable wolfSSL debugging support. Enabling debug support allows easier debugging by compiling with debug information and defining the constant [`DEBUG_WOLFSSL`](#debug_wolfssl) which outputs messages to `stderr`. To turn debug on at runtime, call [`wolfSSL_Debugging_ON()`](group__Debug.md#function-wolfssl_debugging_on). To turn debug logging off at runtime, call [`wolfSSL_Debugging_OFF()`](group__Debug.md#function-wolfssl_debugging_off). For more information, see [Debugging](chapter08.md#debugging).

### `--enable-distro`

Enable wolfSSL distro build.

### `--enable-singlethread`

Enable single threaded mode, no multi thread protections.

Enabling single threaded mode turns off multi thread protection of the session cache. Only enable single threaded mode if you know your application is single threaded or your application is multithreaded and only one thread at a time will be accessing the library.

### `--enable-dtls`

Enable wolfSSL DTLS support

Enabling DTLS support allows users of the library to also use the DTLS protocol in addition to TLS and SSL. For more information, see the [DTLS](chapter04.md#dtls) section.

### `--disable-rng`

Disable compiling and using RNG

### `--enable-sctp`

Enable wolfSSL DTLS-SCTP support

Enable Apache httpd compatibility build

### `--enable-openvpn`

Enable OpenVPN compatibility build

### `--enable-opensslextra`

Enable extra OpenSSL API compatibility, increases the size

Enabling OpenSSL Extra includes a larger set of OpenSSL compatibility functions. The basic build will enable enough functions for most TLS/SSL needs, but if you're porting an application that uses 10s or 100s of OpenSSL calls, enabling this will allow better support. The wolfSSL OpenSSL compatibility layer is under active development, so if there is a function missing which you need, please contact us and we'll try to help. For more information about the OpenSSL Compatibility Layer, please see [OpenSSL Compatibility](chapter13.md#openssl-compatibility).

### `--enable-opensslall`

Enable all OpenSSL API.

### `--enable-maxstrength`

Enable Max Strength build, allows TSLv1.2-AEAD-PFS ciphers only

### `--disable-harden`

Disable Hardened build, Enables Timing Resistance and Blinding

### `--enable-ipv6`

Enable testing of IPv6, wolfSSL proper is IP neutral

Enabling IPV6 changes the test applications to use IPv6 instead of IPv4. wolfSSL proper is IP neutral, either version can be used, but currently the test applications are IP dependent.

### `--enable-bump`

Enable SSL Bump build

### `--enable-leanpsk`

Enable Lean PSK build.

Very small build using PSK, and eliminating many features from the library. Approximate build size for wolfSSL on an embedded system with this enabled is 21kB.

### `--enable-leantls`

Implements a lean TLS 1.2 client only (no client auth), ECC256, AES128 and SHA256 w/o Shamir. Meant to be used by itself at the moment and not in conjunction with other build options.

Enabling produces a small footprint TLS client that supports TLS 1.2 client only (no client auth), ECC256, AES128 and SHA256 w/o Shamir. Meant to be used by itself at the moment and not in conjunction with other build options.

### `--enable-bigcache`

Enable a big session cache.

Enabling the big session cache will increase the session cache from 33 sessions to 20,027 sessions. The default session cache size of 33 is adequate for TLS clients and embedded servers. The big session cache is suitable for servers that aren't under heavy load, basically allowing 200 new sessions per minute or so.

### `--enable-hugecache`

Enable a huge session cache.

Enabling the huge session cache will increase the session cache size to 65,791 sessions. This option is for servers that are under heavy load, over 13,000 new sessions per minute are possible or over 200 new sessions per second.

### `--enable-smallcache`

Enable small session cache.

Enabling the small session cache will cause wolfSSL to only store 6 sessions. This may be useful for embedded clients or systems where the default of nearly 3kB is too much RAM. This define uses less than 500 bytes of RAM.

### `--enable-savesession`

Enable persistent session cache.

Enabling this option will allow an application to persist (save) and restore the wolfSSL session cache to/from memory buffers.

### `--enable-savecert`

Enable persistent cert cache.

Enabling this option will allow an application to persist (save) and restore the wolfSSL certificate cache to/from memory buffers.

Enable wolfSSL sniffer support.

Enabling sniffer (SSL inspection) support will allow the collection of SSL traffic packets as well as the ability to decrypt those packets with the correct key file.

Currently the sniffer supports the following RSA ciphers:

CBC ciphers:

* AES-CBC
* Camellia-CBC
* 3DES-CBC

Stream ciphers:

* RC4
* Rabbit
* HC-128

### `--enable-aesgcm`

Enable AES-GCM support.

Eabling this option will turn on Public Key callbacks, allowing the application to register its own ECC sign/verify and RSA sign/verify and encrypt/decrypt callbacks.

### `--enable-aesccm`

Enable AES-CCM support

Enabling AES-GCM will add these cipher suites to wolfSSL.  wolfSSL offers four different implementations of AES-GCM balancing speed versus memory consumption. If available, wolfSSL will use 64-bit or 32-bit math. For embedded applications, there is a speedy 8-bit version that uses RAM-based lookup tables (8KB per session) which is speed comparable to the 64-bit version and a slower 8-bit version that doesn't take up any additional RAM. The --enable-aesgcm configure option may be modified with the options `=word32`, `=table`, or `=small`, i.e. `--enable-aesgcm=table`.

### `--disable-aescbc`

Used to with [`--disable-aescbc`](#disable-aescbc) to compile out AES-CBC

An elliptic curve offering 128 bits of security and to be used with ECDH key  agreement (see [Cross Compiling](#cross-compiling)). Enabling curve25519 option allows for the use of the curve25519 algorithm. The default curve25519 is set to use more memory but have a faster run time. To have the algorithm use less memory the option `--enable-curve25519=small` can be used. Although using less memory there is a trade off in speed.

### `--enable-ed25519`

Enable ED25519 (or `--enable-ed25519=small` for ED25519\_SMALL)

### `--disable-crypttests`

Disable Crypt Bench/Test

### `--enable-fast-rsa`

Enable RSA using Intel IPP.

Enabling fast-rsa speeds up RSA operations by using IPP libraries. It has a larger memory consumption then the default RSA set by wolfSSL. If IPP libraries can not be found an error message will be displayed during configuration. The first location that autoconf will look is in the directory `wolfssl_root/IPP` the second is standard location for libraries on the machine such as `/usr/lib/` on linux systems.

The libraries used for RSA operations are in the directory `wolfssl-X.X.X/IPP/` where X.X.X is the current wolfSSL version number. Building from the bundled libraries is dependent on the directory location and name of IPP so the file structure of the subdirectory IPP should not be changed.

When allocating memory the fast-rsa operations have a memory tag of `DYNAMIC_TYPE_USER_CRYPTO`. This allows for viewing the memory consumption of RSA operations during run time with the fast-rsa option.

### `--enable-staticmemory`

Enable static memory use

### `--enable-mcapi`

Enable Microchip API

### `--enable-asynccrypt`

Enable Asynchronous Crypto

### `--enable-sessionexport`

Enable export and import of sessions

### `--enable-aeskeywrap`

### `--enable-jobserver`

Values: `yes` (default) / `no` / `#`

When using `make` this builds wolfSSL using a multithreaded build, `yes` (default) detects the number of CPU cores and builds using a recommended amount of jobs for that count, `#` to specify an exact number. This works in a similar way to the `make -j` option.

### `--enable-shared[=PKGS]`

Building shared wolfSSL libraries [default=yes]

Disabling the shared library build will exclude a wolfSSL shared library from being built. By default only a shared library is built in order to save time and space.

### `--enable-static[=PKGS]`

Building static wolfSSL libraries [default=no]

### `--with-liboqs=PATH`

Path to OpenQuantumSafe install (default `/usr/local`).

This turns on the ability for wolfSSL to use the experimental TLS 1.3 quantum-safe KEM groups, hybrid quantum-safe KEM groups and FALCON signature scheme via wolfSSL integration with liboqs. Please see the appendix "Experimenting with Quantum-Safe Cryptography" in this document for more details.

### `--with-libz=PATH`

Optionally include libz for compression.

Enabling libz will allow compression support in wolfSSL from the libz library. Think twice about including this option and using it by calling [`wolfSSL_set_compression()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfssl_set_compression). While compressing data before sending decreases the actual size of the messages being sent and received, the amount of data saved by compression usually takes longer in time to analyze than it does to send it raw on all but the slowest of networks.

### `--with-cavium`

Path to cavium/software directory.

### `--with-user-crypto`

Path to USER\_CRYPTO install (default `/usr/local`).

### `--enable-rsavfy`

Enables RSA verify only support (**note** requires [`--enable-cryptonly`](#enable-cryptonly))

### `--enable-rsapub`

Default value: Enabled RSA public key only support (**note** requires [`--enable-cryptonly`](#enable-cryptonly))

### `--enable-armasm`

Enables ARMv8 ASM support.

The default configure sets mcpu or mfpu based on 64 vs 32 bit system. It does not overwrite mcpu or mfpu setting passed in by use of CPPFLAGS. On some compilers `-mstrict-align` may be needed due to the constraiants and `-mstrict-align` is now also set by default unless a user passes in mcpu/mfpu flags with `CPPFLAGS`.

### `--disable-tlsv12`

Disable TLS 1.2 support

### `--enable-tls13`

Enable TLS 1.3 support

This build option can be combined with [`--disable-tlsv12`](#disable-tlsv12) and [`--disable-oldtls`](#disable-oldtlx) to produce a wolfSSL build that is only TLS 1.3.

### `--enable-all`

Enables all wolfSSL features, excluding SSL v3

### `--enable-xts`

Enables AES-XTS mode

### `--enable-asio`

Enables ASIO.

Requires that the options [`--enable-opensslextra`](#enable-opensslextra) and [`--enable-opensslall`](#enable-opensslall) be enabled when configuring wolfSSL. If these two options are not enabled, then the autoconf tool will automatically enable these options to enable ASIO when configuring wolfSSL.

### `--enable-qt`

Enables Qt 5.12 onwards support.

Enables wolfSSL build settings compatible with the wolfSSL Qt port. Patch file is required from wolfSSL for patching Qt source files.

### `--enable-qt-test`

Enable Qt test compatibility build.

Enables support for building wolfSSL for compatibility with running the built-in Qt tests.

### `--enable-apache-httpd`

Enables Apache httpd support

### `--enable-afalg`

Enables use of Linux module AF\_ALG for hardware accleration. Additional Xilinx use with `=xilinx`, `=xilinx-rsa`, `=xilinx-aes`, `=xilinx-sha3`

Is similar to [`--enable-devcrypto`](#enable-devcrypto) in that it leverages a Linux kernel module (AF\_ALG) for offloading crypto operations. On some hardware the module has performance accelerations available through the Linux crypto drivers. In the case of Petalinux with Xilinx the flag `--enable-afalg=xilinx` can be used to tell wolfSSL to use the Xilinx interface for AF\_ALG.

### `--enable-devcrypto`

Enables use of Linux `/dev/crypto` for hardware acceleration.

Has the ability to receive arguments, being able to receive any combination of `aes` (all aes support), `hash` (all hash algorithms), and `cbc` (aes-cbc only). If no options are given, it will default to using `all`.

### `--enable-mcast`

Enable wolfSSL DTLS multicast support

### `--disable-pkcs12`

Disable PKCS12 code

### `--enable-fallback-scsv`

Enables Signaling Cipher Suite Value(SCSV)

### `--enable-psk-one-id`

See USE_FAST_MATH and Big Integer Math Library sections.

### `--enable-fasthugemath`

Enable fast math + huge code.

Enabling fasthugemath includes support for the Fastmath library and greatly increases the code size by unrolling loops for popular key sizes during public key operations. Try using the benchmark utility before and after using fasthugemath to see if the slight speedup is worth the increased code size.

### `--enable-sp-math`

Enable Single-Precision (SP) math implementation with restricted algorithm suite. Unsupported algorithms are disabled. Overrides `--enable-sp`, `--enable-sp-math-all`, `--enable-fastmath` and `--enable-fasthugemath`.

### `--enable-sp-math-all`

Enable Single-Precision (SP) math implementation with full algorithm suite. Unsupported algorithms are enabled, but unoptimized. Overrides `--enable-sp`, `--enable-fastmath` and `--enable-fasthugemath`.

### `--enable-sp-asm`

Enable Single-Precision (SP) assembly implementation.

Can be used to enable Single-Precision performance improvements through assembly with Intel x86\_64 and ARM architectures.

### `--enable-sp=OPT`

Enable Single-Precision (SP) math for RSA, DH, and ECC to improve performance.

There are many possible values for OPT. Below is a list of ways to call enable-sp and the resulting macros that will be defined as a result. All of these can be combined in a coma separated list. For example, `--enable-sp=ec256,ec384`. The meaning of the macros that will be defined are defined above in the [wolfSSL’s Proprietary Single Precision (SP) Math Support] section. 

**NOTE**: This is for x86_64 and with no other configuration flags; your results may vary depending on your architectures and other configuration flags that you specify. For example,  WOLFSSL_SP_384 and WOLFSSL_SP_4096 will only be enabled for Intel x86_64.

## Cross Compiling

Many users on embedded platforms cross compile wolfSSL for their environment. The easiest way to cross compile the library is to use the `./configure` system. It will generate a Makefile which can then be used to build wolfSSL.

When cross compiling, you’ll need to specify the host to `./configure`, such as:

```sh
./configure --host=arm-linux
```

You may also need to specify the compiler, linker, etc. that you want to use:

```sh
./configure --host=arm-linux CC=arm-linux-gcc AR=arm-linux-ar RANLIB=arm-linux
```

There is a bug in the configure system which you might see when cross compiling and detecting user overriding malloc. If you get an undefined reference to `rpl_malloc` and/or `rpl_realloc`, please add the following to your `./configure` line:

```sh
ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes ac_cv_func_realloc_0_nonnull=yes
```

After correctly configuring wolfSSL for cross-compilation, you should be able to follow standard autoconf practices for building and installing the library:

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

If you have any additional tips or feedback about cross compiling wolfSSL, please let us know at [info@wolfssl.com](mailto:info@wolfssl.com).

## 2.7 Building Ports

wolfSSL has been ported to many environments and devices. A portion of these ports and accompanying documentation for them is located in the directory `wolfssl-X.X.X/IDE`, where X.X.X is the current wolfSSL version number. This directory also contains helpful information and code for IDE’s used to build wolfSSL for the environments.

PORT Lists:

* Arduino
* LPCXPRESSO
* Wiced Studio
* CSBench
* SGX Windows and Linux
  * These directories (`wolfssl/IDE/WIN-SGX` and `wolfssl/IDE/LINUX-SGX`) contain Makefiles for and Visual Studio solutions for building wolfSSL as a library to be used in an Intel SGX project.
* Hexagon
  * This directory (`wolfssl/IDE/HEXAGON`) contains a Makefile for building with the Hexagon tool chain. It can be used to build wolfSSL for offloading ECC verify operations to a DSP processor. The directory contains a README file to help with the steps required to build.
* Hexiwear
* NetBurner M68K
  * In the directory (`wolfssl/IDE/M68K`) there is a Makefile for building wolfSSL for a MCF5441X device using the Netburner RTOS.
* Renesas
  * This directory (`wolfssl/IDE/Renesas`) contains multiple builds for different Renesas devices. It also has example builds that demonstrate using hardware acceleration.
* XCode
* Eclipse
* Espressif
* IAR-EWARM
* Kinetis Design Studio (KDS)
* Rowley Crossworks ARM
* OpenSTM32
* RISCV
* Zephyr
* Mynewt
* INTIME-RTOS
