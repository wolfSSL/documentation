# Building wolfSSL

wolfSSL was written with portability in mind and should generally be easy to build on most systems. If you have difficulty building wolfSSL, please don’t hesitate to seek support through our support forums (<https://www.wolfssl.com/forums>) or contact us directly at [support@wolfssl.com](mailto:support@wolfssl.com).

This chapter explains how to build wolfSSL on Unix and Windows, and provides guidance for building wolfSSL in a non-standard environment. You will find the “getting started” guide in [Chapter 3](chapter03.md#getting-started) and an SSL tutorial in [Chapter 11](chapter11.md#ssl-tutorial).

When using the autoconf / automake system to build wolfSSL, wolfSSL uses a single Makefile to build all parts and examples of the library, which is both simpler and faster than using Makefiles recursively.

## Getting wolfSSL Source Code

The most recent version of wolfSSL can be downloaded from the wolfSSL website as a ZIP file:

<https://www.wolfssl.com/download>

After downloading the ZIP file, unzip the file using the `unzip` command. To use native line endings, enable the `-a` modifier when using unzip. From the unzip man page, the `-a` modifier functionality is described:

> [...] The -a option causes files identified by zip as text files (those with
> the ‘t’ label in zipinfo listings, rather than ‘b’) to be automatically
> extracted as such, converting line endings, end-of-file characters
> and the character set itself as necessary. [...]

**NOTE**: Beginning with the release of wolfSSL 2.0.0rc3, the directory structure of wolfSSL was changed as well as the standard install location. These changes were made to make it easier for open source projects to integrate wolfSSL. For more information on header and structure changes, please see [Library Headers](chapter09.md#library-headers) and [Structure Usage](#structure-usage).

## Building on Unix-like Systems

When building wolfSSL on Linux, \*BSD, OS X, Solaris, or other \*nix-like systems, use the autoconf system. To build wolfSSL you only need to run two commands from the wolfSSL root directory, `./configure` and `make`.

The `./configure` script sets up the build environment and you can append any number of build options to `./configure`. For a list of available build options, please see [Build Options](#build-options) or run the following command to see a list of possible options to pass to the `./configure` script:

```sh
./configure --help
```

Once `./configure` has successfully executed, to build wolfSSL, run:

```sh
make
```

To install wolfSSL run:

```sh
make install
```

You may need superuser privileges to install, in which case precede the command with sudo:

```sh
sudo make install
```

To test the build, run the testsuite program from the root wolfSSL directory:

```sh
./testsuite/testsuite.test
```

Alternatively you can use autoconf to run the testsuite as well as the standard wolfSSL API and crypto tests:

```sh
make test
```

Further details about expected output of the testsuite program can be found in the [Testsuite section](chapter03.md#testsuite). If you want to build only the wolfSSL library and not the additional items (examples, testsuite, benchmark app, etc.), you can run the following command fromthe wolfSSL root directory:

```sh
make src/libwolfssl.la
```

## Building on Windows

In addition to the instructions below, you can find instructions and tips for building wolfSSL with Visual Studio [here](https://wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/Docs-wolfssl-visual-studio.html).

### VS 2008

Solutions are included for Visual Studio 2008 in the root directory of the install. For use with Visual Studio 2010 and later, the existing project files should be able to be converted during the import process.

**Note**:
If importing to a newer version of VS you will be asked: “Do you want to overwrite the project and its imported property sheets?” You can avoid the following by selecting “No”. Otherwise if you select “Yes”, you will see warnings about `EDITANDCONTINUE` being ignored due to `SAFESEH` specification. You will need to right click on the testsuite, sslSniffer, server, echoserver, echoclient, and client individually and modify their Properties-\>Configuration Properties-\>Linker-\>Advanced (scroll all the way to the bottom in Advanced window). Locate “Image Has Safe Exception Handlers” and click the drop down arrow on the far right. Change this to No (`/SAFESEH:NO`) for each of the aforementioned. The other option is to disable `EDITANDCONTINUE` which, we have found to be useful for debugging purposes and is therefore not recommended for production software.

### VS 2010

You will need to download Service Pack 1 to build wolfSSL solution once it has been updated. If VS reports a linker error, clean and rebuild the project; the linker error should be taken care of.

### VS 2013 (64 bit solution)

You will need to download Service Pack 4 to build wolfSSL solution once it has been updated. If VS reports a linker error, clean and rebuild the project; the linker error should be taken care of.

To test each build, choose “Build All” from the Visual Studio menu and then run the testsuite program. To edit build options in the Visual Studio project, select your desired project (wolfssl, echoclient, echoserver, etc.) and browse to the “Properties” panel.

**Note**: After the wolfSSL v3.8.0 release the build preprocessor macros were moved to a centralized file located at `IDE/WIN/user_settings.h`. This file can also be found in the project. To add features such as ECC or ChaCha20/Poly1305, add `#defines` here such as `HAVE_ECC` or `HAVE_CHACHA` / `HAVE_POLY1305`.

### Cygwin

If building wolfSSL for Windows on a Windows development machine, we recommend using the included Visual Studio project files to build wolfSSL. However, if Cygwin is required here is a short guide on how our team achieved a successful build:

1. Go to <https://www.cygwin.com/install.html> and download `setup-x86_64.exe`
2. Run `setup-x86_64.exe` and install however you choose. Click through the installation menus until you reach the "Select Packages" stage.
3. Click on the "+" icon to expand "All"
4. Now go to the "Archive" section and select "unzip" drop down, change "Skip" to 6.0-15 (or some other version).
5. Under "Devel" click "autoconf" drop down and change "Skip" to "10-1" (or some other version)
6. Under "Devel" click "automake" drop down and change "Skip" to "10-1" (or some other version)
7. Under "Devel" click the "gcc-core" drop down and change "Skip" to 7.4.0-1 (NOTE: wolfSSL has not tested GCC 9 or 10 and as they are fairly new does not recommend using them until they have had a bit more time to be fine-tuned for development).
8. Under "Devel" click the "git" drop down and change "Skip" to 2.29.0-1 (or some other version)
9. Under "Devel" click "libtool" drop down and change "Skip" to "2.4.6-5" (or some other version)
10. Under "Devel" click the "make" drop down and change "Skip" to 4.2.1-1 (or some other version)
11. Click "Next" and proceed through the rest of the installation.

The additional packages list should include:

* unzip
* autoconf
* automake
* gcc-core
* git
* libtool
* make

#### Post Install

Open a Cygwin terminal and clone wolfSSL:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl.git
cd wolfssl
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check
```

## Building in a non-standard environment

While not officially supported, we try to help users wishing to build wolfSSL in a non-standard environment, particularly with embedded and cross-compilation systems. Below are some notes on getting started with this.

1. The source and header files need to remain in the same directory structure as they are in the wolfSSL download package.
2. Some build systems will want to explicitly know where the wolfSSL header files are located, so you may need to specify that. They are located in the `<wolfssl_root>/wolfssl` directory. Typically, you can add the `<wolfssl_root>` directory to your include path to resolve header problems.
3. wolfSSL defaults to a little endian system unless the configure process detects big endian. Since users building in a non-standard environment aren't using the configure process, `BIG_ENDIAN_ORDER` will need to be defined if using a big endian system.
4. wolfSSL benefits speed-wise from having a 64-bit type available. The configure process determines if long or long long is 64 bits and if so sets up a define. So if `sizeof(long)` is 8 bytes on your system, define `SIZEOF_LONG 8`. If it isn't but `sizeof(long long)` is 8 bytes, then define `SIZEOF_LONG_LONG 8`.
5. Try to build the library, and let us know if you run into any problems. If you need help, contact us at [info@wolfssl.com](mailto:info@wolfssl.com).
6. Some defines that can modify the build are listed in the following sub-sections, below. For more verbose descriptions of many options, please see [Build Options](#build-options).

### Building into Yocto Linux

wolfSSL also includes recipes for building wolfSSL on Yocto Linux and OpenEmbedded. These recipes are maintained within the meta-wolfSSL layer as a GitHub repository, here: <https://github.com/wolfSSL/meta-wolfssl>. Building wolfSSL on Yocto Linux will require Git and bitbake. The following steps list how to get some wolfSSL products (that recipes exist for) built on Yocto Linux.

1. **Cloning wolfSSL meta**

    This can be done through a git-clone command of the following URL:
    <https://github.com/wolfSSL/meta-wolfssl>

2. **Insert the "meta-wolfSSL" layer into the build's bblayers.conf**

    Within the `BBLAYERS` section, add the path to the location where meta-wolfssl
    was cloned into. Example:

    ```sh
    BBLAYERS ?= "... \
    /path/to/meta-wolfssl/ \
    ..."
    ```

3. **Build a wolfSSL product recipe**

    bitbake can be used to build one of the three following wolfSSL product recipes:
    *wolfssl*, *wolfssh*, and *wolfmqtt*. Simply pass one of those recipes into the bitbake
    command (example: `bitbake wolfssl`). This allows the user to personally
    confirm compilation succeeds without issues.

4. **Edit local.conf**

    The final step is to edit the build's local.conf file, which allows desired libraries to
    be included with the image being built. Edit the `IMAGE_INSTALL_append` line
    to include the name of the desired recipe(s). An example of this is shown below:

    ```sh
    IMAGE_INSTALL_append = "wolfssl wolfssh wolfmqtt"
    ```

Once the image has been built, wolfSSL's default location (or related products from recipes) will be the `/usr/lib/` directory.

Additionally, wolfSSL can be customized when building into Yocto by using the enable and disable options listed in [Build Options](#build-options). This requires creating a `.bbappend` file and placing it within the wolfSSL application/recipe layer. The contents of this file should include a line specifying content to concatenate onto the `EXTRA_OECONF` variable. An example of this is shown below to enable TLS 1.3 support through the TLS 1.3 enable option:

```sh
EXTRA_OECONF += "--enable-tls13"
```

Further documentation on building into Yocto can be found in the meta-wolfssl README, located here: <https://github.com/wolfSSL/meta-wolfssl/blob/master/README.md>

### Building with Atollic TrueSTUDIO

Versions of wolfSSL following 3.15.5 include a TrueSTUDIO project file that is used to build wolfSSL on ARM M4-Cortex devices. The TrueSTUDIO project file simplifies the process of building on STM32 devices, is free to download, and is createed by Atollic - a part of ST Microelectronics. To build the wolfSSL static library project file in TrueSTUDIO, it will require the user perform the following steps after opening TrueSTUDIO:

1. Import the project into the workspace (File > Import)
2. Build the project (Project > Build project)

The build then includes the settings located inside of `user_settings.h` at build-time. The default content of the `user_settings.h` file is minimal, and does not contain many features. Users are able to modify this file and add or remove features with options listed in the remainder of this chapter.

### Building with IAR

The `<wolfssl_root>/IDE/IAR-EWARM` directory contains the following files:

1. Workspace: `wolfssl.eww`
   The workspace includes wolfSSL-Lib library and wolfCrypt-test, wolfCrypt-benchmark
   executable projects.
2. wolfSSL-Lib Project: `lib/wolfSSL-lib.ewp`
   generates full set library of wolfCrypt and wolfSSL functions.
3. Test suites Project: `test/wolfCrypt-test.ewp`
   generates test.out test suites executable
4. Benchmark Project: `benchmark/wolfCrypt-benchmark.ewp`
   generates benchmark.out benchmark executable

These projects have been set up to generic ARM Cortex-M MPUs. In order to generate project for specific target MPU, take following steps.

1. Default Setting: Default Target of the projects are set to Cortex-M3 Simulator. user_settings.h includes default options for the projects. You can build and
download the to the simulator. Open Terminal I/O window, by "view"->"Terminal I/O", and start execution.

2. Project option settings: For each project, choose appropriate "Target" options.

3. For executable projects: Add "SystemInit" and "startup" for your MPU, choose your debug "Driver".

4. For benchmark project: Choose option for current_time function or write your own "current_time" benchmark timer with WOLFSSL_USER_CURRTIME option.

5. Build and download: Go to "Project->Make" and "Download and Debug" in Menu bar for EWARM build and download.

### Building on OS X and iOS

#### XCODE

The `<wolfssl_root>/IDE/XCODE` directory contains the following files:

1. `wolfssl.xcworkspace` -- workspace with library and testsuite client
2. `wolfssl_testsuite.xcodeproj` -- project to run the testsuite.
3. `wolfssl.xcodeproj` -- project to build OS/x and iOS libraries for wolfSSL and/or wolfCrypt
4. `wolfssl-FIPS.xcodeproj` -- project to build wolfSSL and wolfCrypt-FIPS if available
5. `user_settings.h` -- custom library settings, which are shared across projects

The library will output as `libwolfssl_osx.a` or `libwolfssl_ios.a` depending on the target. It will also copy the wolfSSL/wolfCrypt (and the CyaSSL/CtaoCrypt
compatibility) headers into an `include` directory located in
`Build/Products/Debug` or `Build/Products/Release`.

For the library and testsuite to link properly the build location needs to be configured relative to the workspace.

1. File -> Workspace Settings (or Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations -> Locations)
2. Derived Data -> Advanced
3. Custom -> Relative to Workspace
4. Products -> Build/Products

These Xcode projects define the `WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS` preprocessor to enable the `user_settings.h` file for setting macros across multiple projects.

If needed the Xcode preprocessors can be modified with these steps:

1. Click on the Project in "Project Navigator".
2. Click on the "Build Settings" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "Apple LLVM 6.0 - Preprocessing" section.
4. Open the disclosure for "Preprocessor Macros" and use the "+" and
"-" buttons to modify. Remember to do this for both Debug and Release.

This project should build wolfSSL and wolfCrypt using the default settings.

### Building with GCC ARM

In the `<wolfssl_root>/IDE/GCC-ARM` directory, you will find an example wolfSSL project for Cortex M series, but it can be adopted for other architectures.

1. Make sure you have `gcc-arm-none-eabi` installed.
2. Modify the `Makefile.common`:
   * Use correct toolchain path `TOOLCHAIN`.
   * Use correct architecture 'ARCHFLAGS'. See [GCC ARM Options](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.3/gcc/ARM-Options.html) `-mcpu=name`.
   * Confirm memory map in linker.ld matches your flash/ram or comment out `SRC_LD = -T./linker.ld` in Makefile.common.
3. Use `make` to build the static library (libwolfssl.a), wolfCrypt test/benchmark and wolfSSL TLS client targets as `.elf` and `.hex` in `/Build`.

#### Building with generic makefile cross-compile

Example `Makefile.common` changes for Raspberry Pi with Cortex-A53:

1. In Makefile.common change `ARCHFLAGS` to `-mcpu=cortex-a53 -mthumb`.
2. Comment out `SRC_LD`, since custom memory map is not applicable.
3. Clear `TOOLCHAIN`, so it will use default `gcc`. Set `TOOLCHAIN =`
4. Comment out `LDFLAGS += --specs=nano.specs` and `LDFLAGS += --specs=nosys.specs` to nosys and nano.

#### Building with configure with cross-compile

The configure script in the main project directory can perform a cross-compile
build with the gcc-arm-none-eabi tools. Assuming the tools are installed in
your executable path:

```sh
./configure \
  --host=arm-non-eabi \
  CC=arm-none-eabi-gcc \
  AR=arm-none-eabi-ar \
  STRIP=arm-none-eabi-strip \
  RANLIB=arm-none-eabi-ranlib \
  --prefix=/path/to/build/wolfssl-arm \
  CFLAGS="-march=armv8-a --specs=nosys.specs \
      -DHAVE_PK_CALLBACKS -DWOLFSSL_USER_IO -DNO_WRITEV" \
  --disable-filesystem --enable-fastmath \
  --disable-shared
make
make install
```

If you are building for a 32-bit architecture, add `-DTIME_T_NOT_64BIT` to the
list of CFLAGS.

### Building on Keil MDK-ARM

You can find detailed instructions and tips for building wolfSSL on Keil MDK-ARM [here](https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/keil-mdk-arm/).

**Note**: If MDK-ARM is not installed in the default installation location, you need to change all of the referencing path definitions in the project file to the
install location.

## Features Defined as C Pre-processor Macro

### Removing Features

The following defines can be used to remove features from wolfSSL. This can be helpful if you are trying to reduce the overall library footprint size. In addition to defining a `NO_<feature-name>` define, you can also remove the respective source file as well from the build (but not the header file).

#### NO_WOLFSSL_CLIENT

Removes calls specific to the client and is for server-only builds. You should only use this if you want to remove a few calls for the sake of size.

#### NO_WOLFSSL_SERVER

Likewise removes calls specific to the server side.

#### NO_DES3

Removes the use of DES3 encryptions. DES3 is built-in by default because some older servers still use it and it's required by SSL 3.0. `NO_DH` and `NO_AES` are the same as the two above, they are widely used.

#### NO_DSA

Removes DSA since it's being phased out of popular use.

#### NO_ERROR_STRINGS

Disables error strings. Error strings are located in `src/internal.c` for wolfSSL or `wolfcrypt/src/asn.c` for wolfCrypt.

#### NO_HMAC

Removes HMAC from the build.

**NOTE**: SSL/TLS depends on HMAC but if you are only using wolfCrypt IE build option `WOLFCRYPT_ONLY` then HMAC can be disabled in this case.

#### NO_MD4

Removes MD4 from the build, MD4 is broken and shouldn't be used.

#### NO_MD5

Removes MD5 from the build.

#### NO_SHA

Removes SHA-1 from the build.

#### NO_SHA256

Removes SHA-256 from the build.

#### NO_PSK

Turns off the use of the pre-shared key extension. It is built-in by default.

#### NO_PWDBASED

Disables password-based key derivation functions such as PBKDF1, PBKDF2, and PBKDF from PKCS #12.

#### NO_RC4

Removes the use of the ARC4 stream cipher from the build. ARC4 is built-in by default because it is still popular and widely used.

#### NO_SESSION_CACHE

Can be defined when a session cache is not needed. This should reduce memory use by nearly 3 kB.

#### NO_TLS

Turns off TLS. We do not recommend turning off TLS.

#### SMALL_SESSION_CACHE

Can be defined to limit the size of the SSL session cache used by wolfSSL. This will reduce the default session cache from 33 sessions to 6 sessions and save approximately 2.5 kB.

#### NO_RSA

Removes support for the RSA algorithm.

#### WC_NO_RSA_OAEP

Removes code for OAEP padding.

#### NO_AES_CBC

Turns off AES-CBC algorithm support.

#### NO_AES_DECRYPT

Can be set to reduce code size. Set to disable the decrypt and only support encryption.

#### WOLFCRYPT_ONLY

Enables wolfCrypt only while disabling TLS.

#### NO_CAMELLIA_CBC

Disables Camellia CBC support but only applies to TLS cipher suites only.

#### NO_AES

Disables AES algorithm support.

#### NO_AES_128

Used for AES key size selection at compile time.

#### NO_AES_192

Used for AES key size selection at compile time.

#### NO_AES_256

Used for AES key size selection at compile time.

#### NO_AESGCM_AEAD

Used for disabliing TLS cipher suites thst use AES GCM. It is used internally when no AES GCM cipher suites are enabled, but can also be used to limit cipher suites.

#### NO_ASN_TIME

Disables time checking for ASN. Note: This should be used with caution because all certificate begin/end date checking will be skipped.

#### NO_CHECK_PRIVATE_KEY

This macro disables additional private key checking that is on by default. This enables checking to validate the private key is a pair for the public key. It is supported for RSA, ECDSA, ED25519, ED448, Falcon, Dilithium and Sphincs.

#### NO_DH

Disables Diffie-Hellman (DH) support.

#### NO_ED25519_CLIENT_AUTH

Disables TLS client authentication support for ED25519. It is used to reduce memory usage during TLS if ED25519 is not used, since it requires caching messages.

#### NO_ED448_CLIENT_AUTH

Disables client authentification for ED448.

#### NO_FORCE_SCR_SAME_SUITE

By default secure renegotiation requires using the same cipher suite. This disables that requirement.

#### NO_MULTIBYTE_PRINT

Used for compiling out special characters that embedded devices may have problems with.

#### NO_OLD_SSL_NAMES

This disables some of the old OpenSSL compatibility macros for using wolfSSL and OpenSSL together.

#### NO_OLD_WC_NAMES

Removes unneeded namespace.

#### NO_OLD_POLY1305

This disables support for the old ChaCha20/Poly1305 TLS 1.2 cipher suite that is typically used for interop.

#### NO_HANDSHAKE_DONE_CB

Disables support for the handshake callback set with `wolfSSL_SetHsDoneCb`. This option is useful for reducing code size.

#### NO_STDIO_FILESYSTEM

This disables include of stdio.h. Used with portability.

#### NO_TLS_DH

Excludes TLS DH. Should not negotiate cipher suites based on ephemeral finite-field Diffie-Hellman key agreement.

#### NO_WOLFSSL_CM_VERIFY

Disables the Certificate Manager verify callback. The verify callback allows intercepting errors and overriding them. This option is useful for reducing code size.

#### NO_WOLFSSL_DIR

Disable directory support.

#### NO_WOLFSSL_RENESAS_TSIP_TLS_SESSION

For disabling only the TSIP TLS-linked Common key encryption method. Note: This is a Renesas RX TSIP specific define.

#### NO_WOLFSSL_SHA256

This applies to TLS 1.3 only. It allows SHA2-256 to be enabled and usable from wolfCrypt, but exclude it from TLS 1.3.

#### WOLFSSL_BLIND_PRIVATE_KEY

Used as a mask to blind the private key. The blinding is used to proctect aginst Rowhammer attacks.

#### WOLFSSL_DTLS13_NO_HRR_ON_RESUME

If defined, a DTLS server will not do a cookie exchange on successful client resumption: the resumption will be faster (one RTT less) and will consume less bandwidth (one ClientHello and one HelloVerifyRequest/HelloRetryRequest less). On the other hand, if a valid SessionID/ticket/psk is collected, forged clientHello messages will consume resources on the server. For DTLS 1.3, using this option also allows for the server to process Early Data/0-RTT Data. Without this, the Early Data would be dropped since the server doesn't enter stateful processing until receiving a verified ClientHello with the cookie. To allow DTLS 1.3 resumption without the cookie exchange:- Compile wolfSSL with `WOLFSSL_DTLS13_NO_HRR_ON_RESUME` defined - Call wolfSSL_dtls13_no_hrr_on_resume(ssl, 1) on the WOLFSSL object to disable the cookie exchange on resumption - Continue like with a normal connection.

#### WOLFSSL_NO_CLIENT_AUTH

Disables the caching code required for using Ed25519 and Ed448.

#### WOLFSSL_NO_CURRDIR

Portability macro for platforms that do not support ./ for test paths in wolfssl/test.h. Applies to testing tools only.

#### WOLFSSL_NO_DEF_TICKET_ENC_CB

No default ticket encryption callback, server only. The application must set its own callback to use session tickets.

#### WOLFSSL_NO_SOCK

Portability macro for disabling built-in socket support. If using TLS without sockets typically `WOLFSSL_USER_IO` would be defined and callbacks used for send/recv.

#### WOLFSSL_NO_TLS12

Define to exlude TLS 1.2.

#### WOLFSSL_PEM_TO_DER

Key and cert generation feature support for disabling PEM to DER.

#### NO_DEV_URANDOM

Disables the use of `/dev/urandom`

#### WOLFSSL_NO_SIGALG

Disables the signature algorithms extension

#### NO_RESUME_SUITE_CHECK

Disables the check of cipher suite when resuming a TLS connection

#### NO_ASN

Removes support for ASN formatted certificate processing.

#### NO_OLD_TLS

Removes support for SSLv3, TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1

#### WOLFSSL_AEAD_ONLY

Removes support for non-AEAD algorithms. AEAD stands for “authenticated encryption with associated data” which means these algorithms (such as AES-GCM) do not just encrypt and decrypt data, they also assure confidentiality and authenticity of that data.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_NO_2048

Removes RSA/DH 2048-bit Single-Precision (SP) optimization.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_NO_3072

Removes RSA/DH 3072-bit Single-Precision (SP) optimization.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_NO_256

Removes ECC Single-Precision (SP) optimization for SECP256R1. Only applies to `WOLFSSL_SP_MATH`.


### Enabling Features macros (on by default)

#### HAVE_TLS_EXTENSIONS

Enables support for TLS extensions, which are required for most TLS builds. Enabled by default with `./configure`, but needs to be manually defined if building with `WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS`.

#### HAVE_SUPPORTED_CURVES

Enables the TLS supported curves and key share extensions used with TLS. Required with ECC, Curve25519 and Curve448. Enabled by default with `./configure`, but needs to be manually defined if building with `WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS`.

#### HAVE_EXTENDED_MASTER

Enables extended master secret PRF for calculation of session keys used with TLS v1.2 and older. The PRF method is on by default and is considered more secure. This is on by default if using `./configure`, but needs to be manually defined if building with `WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS`.

#### HAVE_ENCRYPT_THEN_MAC

Enables encrypt-then-mac support to perform mac after encryption with block ciphers. This is the default and improves security. This is on by default if using `./configure`, but needs to be manually defined if building with `WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS`.

#### HAVE_ONE_TIME_AUTH

Required if using Chacha20/Poly1305 with TLS v1.2 for setting up Poly authentication. This is on by default with ChaCha20/Poly1305 if using `./configure`, but needs to be manually defined if building with `WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS`.


### Enabling Features Disabled by Default

#### WOLFSSL_CERT_GEN

Turns on wolfSSL’s certificate generation functionality. See [Keys and Certificates](chapter07.md#keys-and-certificates) for more information.

#### WOLFSSL_DER_LOAD

Allows loading DER-formatted CA certs into the wolfSSL context (`WOLFSSL_CTX`) using the function [`wolfSSL_CTX_der_load_verify_locations()`](group__CertsKeys.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_der_load_verify_locations).

#### WOLFSSL_DTLS

Turns on the use of DTLS, or datagram TLS. This isn't widely supported or used.

#### WOLFSSL_KEY_GEN

Turns on wolfSSL’s RSA key generation functionality. See [Keys and Certificates](chapter07.md#keys-and-certificates) for more information.

#### WOLF_PRIVATE_KEY_ID

This is used with PKCS11 to enable support for key ID and label API's. FIPS v5 and older doesn't support `WOLF_PRIVATE_KEY_ID` with Crypto Callbacks.

#### WOLFSSL_WOLFSENTRY_HOOKS

This switch adds support in the TLS layer for generic network `accept` and `connect` filter hooks, using `wolfSSL_CTX_set_AcceptFilter()` and `wolfSSL_CTX_set_ConnectFilter()`. It also activates wolfSentry integration in the example client and server applications.

#### WOLFSSL_CERT_EXT

Certificate extension, key and cert generation feature.

#### WOLFSSL_CERT_REQ

Certificate request, key, and cert generation feature.

#### WOLFSSL_SSLKEYLOGFILE

This enables the key logging used by Wireshark. It does produce a compiler warning since the master secret and client random are written to a file. This is useful for testing and not recommended for production.

#### WOLFSSL_SSLKEYLOGFILE_OUTPUT

This macro defines the filename for the key logging. It is used with `WOLFSSL_SSLKEYLOGFILE`.

#### WOLFSSL_HAVE_WOLFSCEP

Enable feature used by autoconf to see if wolfSCEP is available.

#### WOLFSSL_HAVE_MIN

This macro is for portability of the library to indicate if MIN/MAX are already defined by the platform. It prevents duplicate definitions.

#### WOLFSSL_HAVE_TLS_UNIQUE

Keeps the "Finished" messages after a TLS handshake for use as the "tls-unique" channel binding. Added in libest port: allow applications to get the 'tls-unique' Channel Binding Type (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5929#section-3).

OpenSSL compatibility application specific. Use, nginx `(--enable-nginx) WOLFSSL_NGINX`.

#### WOLFSSL_ERROR_CODE_OPENSSL

OpenSSL compatibility API wolfSSL_EVP_PKEY_cmp returns 0 on success and -1 on failure. This behavior is different from OpenSSL. EVP_PKEY_cmp returns:
1: two keys match
0: do not match
-1: key types are different
-2: the operation is not supported
If you want this function to behave the same as openSSL, define WOLFSSL_ERROR_CODE_OPENSSL so that WS_RETURN_CODE translates return codes to match OpenSSL equivalent behavior.

#### WOLFSSL_HARDEN_TLS

Implement the recommendations specified in RFC9325. This macro needs to be defined to the desired number of bits of security. The currently implemented values are 112 and 128 bits. The following macros disable certain checks.

#### TEST_BUFFER_SIZE

Allows overriding the TLS benchmarking test buffer size used with the example client/server `-B` option.

#### FORCE_BUFFER_TEST

Forces use of the test_certs.h buffers instead of using the file system. Used for internal testing only in wolfssl/test.h.

Turns off use of floating point values when performing Diffie Hellman operations and uses tables for `XPOW()` and `XLOG()`. Removes dependency on external math library.

#### WOLFSSL_TRUST_PEER_CERT

Turns on the use of trusted peer certificates. This allows for loading in a peer certificate to match with a connection rather than using a CA. When turned on if a trusted peer certificate is matched than the peer cert chain is not loaded and the peer is considered verified. Using CAs is preferred.

#### WOLFSSL_STATIC_MEMORY

Turns on the use of static memory buffers and functions. This allows for using static memory instead of dynamic.

#### WOLFSSL_STATIC_MEMORY_LEAN

It requires `WOLFSSL_STATIC_MEMORY` to be defined. It uses smaller type sizes for structs requiring memory pool sizes of less than 65k and limits features available, like IO buffers, to reduce footprint size.

#### WOLFSSL_SHA3

Turns on build for SHA3 use. This is support for SHA3 Keccak for the sizes SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384 and SHA3-512. In addition `WOLFSSL_SHA3_SMALL` can be used to trade off performance for resource use.

#### USE_ECDSA_KEYSZ_HASH_ALGO

Will choose a hash algorithm that matches the ephemeral ECDHE key size or the next highest available. This workaround resolves issues with some peers that do not properly support scenarios such as a P-256 key hashed with SHA512.

#### WOLFSSL_ALT_CERT_CHAINS

Allows CA's to be presented by peer, but not part of a valid chain. Default wolfSSL behavior is to require validation of all presented peer certificates. This also allows loading intermediate CA's as trusted and ignoring no signer failures for CA's up the chain to root. The alternate certificate chain mode only requires that the peer certificate validate to a trusted CA.

#### WOLFSSL_SYS_CA_CERTS

Allows wolfSSL to use trusted system CA certificates for verification when [`wolfSSL_CTX_load_system_CA_certs()`](group__CertsKeys.html#function-wolfssl_ctx_load_system_ca_certs) is called, either by loading them into wolfSSL certificate manager, or by invoking system authentication APIs. See [`wolfSSL_CTX_load_system_CA_certs()`](group__CertsKeys.html#function-wolfssl_ctx_load_system_ca_certs) for more details. This preprocessor macro is automatically set by the `--enable-sys-ca-certs` configure option.

#### WOLFSSL_APPLE_NATIVE_CERT_VERIFICATION

Enables the use of Apple's native trust APIs when authenticating TLS peer certificates. Requires [WOLFSSL_SYS_CA_CERTS](#WOLFSSL_SYS_CA_CERTS) to be defined. This macro does not need to be set by the user if building with `configure` or `CMake` on iOS or other apple devices, but should be explicitly set on MacOS if you wish to use the native verification methods.

#### WOLFSSL_CUSTOM_CURVES

This allows the sniffer to decrypt all TLS traffic, even for TLS connections using ephemeral cipher suites. Keylog file sniffing is supported for TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3. WolfSSL can be configured to export a keylog file using the `--enable-keylog-export` configure option, independently from the sniffer feature (NOTE: never do this in a production environment, as it is inherently insecure). To enable sniffer support for keylog files, use the following configure command line and build as before: ./configure --enable-sniffer CPPFLAGS=-DWOLFSSL_SNIFFER_KEYLOGFILE`.

#### WOLFSSL_SNIFFER_STORE_DATA_CB

The Store Data Callback option allows the sniffer to take a callback that is called when storing the application data into a custom buffer rather than into the reallocated data pointer. The callback is called in a loop until all data is consumed. To enable this option, use the following configure command line and build as before: `./configure --enable-sniffer CPPFLAGS=-DWOLFSSL_SNIFFER_STORE_DATA_CB`.

#### WOLFSSL_SNIFFER_WATCH

The Session Watching option allows the sniffer to watch any packet provided without initial setup. It will start to decode all TLS sessions and when the server's certificate is detected, the certificate is given to a callback function provided by the user which should provide the appropriate private key. To enable this option, use the following configure command line and build as before: `./configure --enable-sniffer CPPFLAGS=-DWOLFSSL_SNIFFER_WATCH`.

#### STATIC_BUFFER_LEN

Don't fragment memory from the record header. Expands to: `RECORD_HEADER_SZ`.

#### STATIC_CHUNKS_ONLY

The user has the option to turn off the 16K output option if we are using small static buffers (the default) and SSL_write tries to write data larger than the record we have, dynamically getting it unless the user says only write in static buffer chunks.

#### WOLFSSL_DEF_PSK_CIPHER

Enables user-defined PSK cipher.

#### WOLFSSL_OLD_PRIME_CHECK

Enable feature which uses faster DH and RSA prime checking.

#### WOLFSSL_DTLS_CH_FRAG

Allows a server to process a fragmented second/verified (one containing a valid cookie response) ClientHello message. The first/unverified (one without a cookie extension) ClientHello MUST be unfragmented so that the DTLS server can process it statelessly. This is only implemented for DTLS 1.3. The user MUST call `wolfSSL_dtls13_allow_ch_frag()` on the server to explicitly enable this during runtime. Note: Using DTLS 1.3 + pqc without `WOLFSSL_DTLS_CH_FRAG` will probably fail In this case use `--enable-dtls-frag-ch` to enable it.

#### WOLFSSL_DTLS_MTU_ADDITIONAL_READ_BUFFER

We need additional bytes to read so that we can work with a peer who has a slightly different MTU than us.

A raw serial number byte that writes X509 serial numbers in unsigned binary to a buffer. For all cases, the buffer needs to be at least `EXTERNAL_SERIAL_SIZE` (32). On success, it returns `WOLFSSL_SUCCESS`. Note: this is a internal macro that cannot be user defined.

#### LARGE_STATIC_BUFFERS

Embedded callbacks require large static buffers; make sure it gives the option to enable larger buffers to 16K.

#### LIBWOLFSSL_VERSION_STRING

This is the wolfSSL version string populated for release bundles or when `./configure` is run. There is also a 32-bit HEX version of this in `LIBWOLFSSL_VERSION_HEX`. These come from wolfssl/version.h.


### Customizing or Porting wolfSSL

#### WOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS

If defined, it allows the use of a user-specific settings file. The file must be named `user_settings.h` and exist in the include path. It is included prior to the standard `settings.h` file, so default settings can be overridden.

#### WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS

This extension allows debugging callbacks through the use of signals in an environment without a debugger. It is off by default. It can also be used to set up a timer with blocking sockets. Please see [Callbacks](chapter06.md#callbacks) for more information.

#### WOLF_CRYPTO_CB

 Enable crypto callback support. This feature is also enabled automatically when [`--enable-cryptocb`](#enable-cryptocb) is used.

#### WOLFSSL_DYN_CERT

Allow allocation of subjectCN and publicKey fields when parsing certificates even with WOLFSSL_NO_MALLOC set. If using the WOLFSSL_NO_MALLOC option with RSA certificates the public key needs to be retained for CA's for validate certificates on the peer's certificate. This appears as a ConfirmSignature error -173 BAD_FUNC_ARG, since the ca->publicKey is NULL.

#### WOLFSSL_USER_IO

Allows the user to remove automatic setting of the default I/O functions [`EmbedSend()`](wolfio_8h.md#function-embedsend) and [`EmbedReceive()`](wolfio_8h.md#function-embedrecieve). Used for custom I/O abstraction layer (see [Abstraction Layers](chapter05.md#abstraction-layers) for more details).

#### NO_FILESYSTEM

Is used if stdio isn't available to load certificates and key files. This enables the use of buffer extensions to be used instead of the file ones.

#### NO_INLINE

Disables the automatic inlining of small, heavily used functions. Turning this on will slow down wolfSSL and actually make it bigger since these are small functions, usually much smaller than function call setup/return. You’ll also need to add `wolfcrypt/src/misc.c` to the list of compiled files if you’re not using autoconf.

#### NO_DEV_RANDOM

Disables the use of the default `/dev/random` random number generator. If defined, the user needs to write an OS-specific `GenerateSeed()` function (found in `wolfcrypt/src/random.c`).

#### NO_MAIN_DRIVER

Is used in the normal build environment to determine whether a test application is called on its own or through the testsuite driver application. You'll only need to use it with the test files: `test.c`, `client.c`, `server.c`, `echoclient.c`, `echoserver.c`, and `testsuite.c`

#### NO_WRITEV

Disables simulation of `writev()` semantics.

#### SINGLE_THREADED

Is a switch that turns off the use of mutexes. wolfSSL currently only uses one for the session cache. If your use of wolfSSL is always single threaded you can turn this on.

#### USER_TICKS

Allows the user to define their own clock tick function if time(0) is not wanted. Custom function needs second accuracy, but doesn’t have to be correlated to Epoch. See `LowResTimer()` function in `wolfssl_int.c`.

#### USER_TIME

Disables the use of time.h structures in the case that the user wants (or needs) to use their own. See `wolfcrypt/src/asn.c` for implementation details. The user will need to define and/or implement `XTIME()`, `XGMTIME()`, and `XVALIDATE_DATE()`.

#### USE_CERT_BUFFERS_256

Enables 256-bit test certificate and key buffers located in `<wolfssl_root>/wolfssl/certs_test.h`. Helpful when testing on and porting to embedded systems with no filesystem.

#### USE_CERT_BUFFERS_1024

#### USE_CERT_BUFFERS_4096

Enables 4096-bit test certificate and key buffers located in `<wolfssl_root>/wolfssl/certs_test.h`. Helpful when testing on and porting to embedded systems with no filesystem.

#### USE_CERT_BUFFERS_25519

Enables Ed25519 test certificate and key buffers located in `<wolfssl_root>/wolfssl/certs_test.h`. Helpful when testing on and porting to embedded systems with no filesystem.

#### USE_WOLFSSL_IO

This macro enables callbacks to send/recv. You can find an example of it in use here: (https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl-examples/blob/master/tls/client-tls-callback.c#L6)

#### CUSTOM_RAND_GENERATE_SEED

Allows user to define custom function equivalent to `wc_GenerateSeed(byte* output, word32 sz)`.

#### CUSTOM_RAND_GENERATE_BLOCK

Allows user to define custom random number generation function. Examples of use are as follows.

```sh
./configure --disable-hashdrbg
CFLAGS="-DCUSTOM_RAND_GENERATE_BLOCK= custom_rand_generate_block"
```

Or

```c
/* RNG */
/* #define HAVE_HASHDRBG */
extern int custom_rand_generate_block(unsigned char* output, unsigned int sz);
```

#### NO_PUBLIC_GCM_SET_IV

Use this if you have done your own custom hardware port and not provided a public implementation of [`wc_AesGcmSetIV()`](group__AES.md#function-wc_aesgcmsetiv)

#### NO_PUBLIC_CCM_SET_NONCE

#### WOLFSSL_STM32[F1 | F2 | F4 | F7 | L4]

Use one of these defines when building for the appropriate STM32 device. Update `wolfssl-root/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h` section with regards to the wolfSSL porting guide (<https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/porting-guide/>) as appropriate.

#### WOLFSSL_STM32_CUBEMX

When using the CubeMX tool to generate Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) API’s use this setting to add appropriate support in wolfSSL.

#### WOLFSSL_CUBEMX_USE_LL

When using the CubeMX tool to generate APIs there are two options, HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) or Low Layer (LL). Use this define to control which headers are include in `wolfssl-root/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h` in the `WOLFSSL_STM32[F1/F2/F4/F7/L4]` section.

### Reducing Memory or Code Usage

#### TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT

Can be defined when using fast math ([`USE_FAST_MATH`](#use_fast_math)) on systems with a small stack size. This will get rid of the large static arrays.

#### ECC_TIMING_RESISTANT

This is used as a Timing Resistance feature that enables code in ecc.c to prevent side channel and differential power analysis (DPA) attacks.

#### FUSION_RTOS

A Fusion RTOS implementation is used for tickets to represent the difference between when they are first seen and when they are sent. It returns the time in milliseconds as a 32-bit value.

#### WOLFSSL_SMALL_STACK

Can be used for devices which have a small stack size. This increases the use of dynamic memory in `wolfcrypt/src/integer.c`, but can lead to slower performance.

#### ALT_ECC_SIZE

If using fast math and RSA/DH you can define this to reduce your ECC memory consumption. Instead of using stack for ECC points it will allocate from the heap.

#### ECC_SHAMIR

Uses variation of ECC math that is slightly faster, but doubles heap usage.

#### RSA_LOW_MEM

When defined CRT is not used which saves on some memory but slows down RSA operations. It is off by default.

#### WOLFSSL_SHA3_SMALL

When SHA3 is enabled this macro will reduce build size.

#### WOLFSSL_SMALL_CERT_VERIFY

Verify the certificate signature without using DecodedCert. Doubles up on some code but allows smaller peak heap memory usage. Cannot be used with [`WOLFSSL_NONBLOCK_OCSP`](#wolfssl_nonblock_ocsp).

#### GCM_SMALL

Option to reduce AES GCM code size by calculating at runtime instead of using tables. Possible options are: `GCM_SMALL`, `GCM_WORD32` or `GCM_TABLE`.

#### CURVED25519_SMALL

Defines [`CURVE25519_SMALL`](#curve25519_small) and [`ED25519_SMALL`](#ed25519_small).

#### CURVE25519_SMALL

Use small memory option for curve25519. This uses less memory, but is slower.

#### ED25519_SMALL

Use small memory option for ed25519. This uses less memory, but is slower.

#### USE_SLOW_SHA

#### USE_SLOW_SHA256

Reduces code size by not unrolling loops, which reduces performance for SHA. About 2k smaller and about 25% slower.

#### USE_SLOW_SHA512

Reduces code size by not unrolling loops, which reduces performance for SHA. Over twice as small, but 50% slower.

#### ECC_USER_CURVES

Allow user to choose ECC curve sizes that are enabled. Only the 256-bit curve is enabled by default. To enable others use `HAVE_ECC192`, `HAVE_ECC224`, etc...

#### WOLFSSL_SP_NO_MALLOC

#### WOLFSSL_SP_NO_DYN_STACK

Disable use of dynamic stack items. Used with small code size and not small stack.

#### WOLFSSL_SP_FAST_MODEXP

Compiles in a faster mod_exp implementation at the expense of code size.

#### WC_DISABLE_RADIX_ZERO_PAD

Disable printing of leading zero in hexidecimal string output. For example, if this macro is defined, the value 8 will be printed as the string "0x8" but if it is not defined it will be printed as "0x08". Defining this macro can reduce code size.

#### WC_ASN_NAME_MAX

This allows overriding the maximum name support for an X.509 certificate field.

#### OPENSSL_EXTRA_X509_SMALL

Special small OpenSSL compat layer for certs.


### Increasing Performance

#### USE_INTEL_SPEEDUP

#### WOLFSSL_AESNI

Enables use of AES accelerated operations which are built into some Intel and AMD chipsets. When using this define, the `aes_asm.asm` (for Windows with at&t syntax) or `aes_asm.S` file is used to optimize via the Intel AES new instruction set (AESNI).

#### HAVE_INTEL_RDSEED

Enable Intel’s RDSEED for DRBG seed source.

#### HAVE_INTEL_RDRAND

Enable Intel’s RDRAND instruction for wolfSSL’s random source.

#### FP_ECC

Enables ECC Fixed Point Cache, which speeds up repeated operations against same private key. Can also define number of entries and LUT bits using `FP_ENTRIES` and `FP_LUT` to reduce default static memory usage.

#### WOLFSSL_ASYNC_CRYPT

This enables support for asynchronous cryptography using hardware based adapters such as the Intel QuickAssist or Marvell (Cavium) Nitrox V. The asynchronous code is not included in the public distribution and is available for evaluation by contacting us via email at facts@wolfssl.com.

#### WOLFSSL_NO_ASYNC_IO

This disables the asynchronous I/O networking. Asynchronous I/O is on by default and can take up to around 140 bytes during the handshaking process. If your network interface doesn't return `SOCKET_EWOULDBLOCK` or `SOCKET_EAGAIN` (or `WOLFSSL_CBIO_ERR_WANT_WRITE` for custom I/O callbacks) on writing you can define `WOLFSSL_NO_ASYNC_IO` to have wolfSSL not save the state while building handshake messages.

### GCM Performance Tuning

There are 4 variants of GCM performance:

* `GCM_SMALL` - Smallest footprint, slowest (FIPS validated)
* `GCM_WORD32` - Medium (FIPS validated)
* `GCM_TABLE` - Fast (FIPS validated)
* `GCM_TABLE_4BIT` - Fastest (FIPS validated)

### wolfSSL’s Math Options

There are three math libraries in wolfSSL.

* Big Integer
* Fast Math
* Single Precision Math

When building wolfSSL, only one of these must be used.

Big Integer Library is the most portable option as it is written in C without any assembly. As such it is not optimized for specific architectures. All math variables are instantiated on the heap; minimal stack usage. Unfortunately, Big Integer Library is not timing resistant.

Fast Math Library is a good option. It is implemented using both C and assembly. As such, it has optimizations for specific architectures. All math variables are instantiated on the stack, leading to less heap usage. It can be made timing resistant if the `TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT` macro is defined. We have taken it through FIPS 140-2 and 140-3 certifications.

Single Precision (SP) Math Library is our recommended library. It is implemented using both C and assembly. As such, it has optimizations for specific architectures. All math variables are instantiated on the stack, leading to less heap usage. It is always timing resistant. It is generally optimized for speed at the cost of code size, but is highly configurable to compile out unneeded code. We have taken it through DO-178C certifications.

#### Big Integer Math Library (Deprecation Planned)

This library is planned to be deprecated and removed from the wolfSSL/wolfCrypt library by the end of 2023. If desired this can be enabled with `--enable-heapmath` or `CFLAGS=-DUSE_INTEGER_HEAP_MATH`.

Forked from public domain LibTomMath library. For more information about LibTomMath, please see <https://www.libtom.net/LibTomMath/>. Please note that our fork is considerably more active and secure than the original public domain code.

This library is generally the most portable and easiest to get going with. The negatives to the normal big integer library are that it is slower, it uses a lot of heap memory as all memory is allocated from the heap, requires an `XREALLOC()` implementation, and is not timing resistant. The implementation can be found in `integer.c`.

#### Fast Math

##### USE_FAST_MATH

Forked from public domain LibTomFastMath library. For more information about LibTomFastMath, please see <https://www.libtom.net/TomsFastMath>. Please note that our fork is considerably more active and secure than the original public domain code from LibTomFastMath. We have improved performance, security and code quality. Also we have taken the FastMath code through  FIPS 140-2 and 140-3 certifications.

The FastMath library uses assembly if possible, and will speed up asymmetric private/public key operations like RSA, DH, and DSA. Assembly inclusion is dependent on compiler and processor combinations. Some combinations will need additional configure flags and some may not be possible. Help with optimizing FastMath with new assembly routines is available on a consulting basis. See the Architecture-Specific Optimizations.

For FastMath, all memory is allocated on the stack. Because the stack memory usage can be larger when using FastMath, we recommend defining [`TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT`](#tfm_timing_resistant) as well when using this option. The FastMath code is timing resistant if TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT is defined. This will reduce some of the large math windows for constant time, which use less memory. This uses less stack because there are no shortcuts and therefore less branching during private key operations. This also makes the implementation more secure as timing attacks are a real threat and can give malicious third parties enough information to reproduce the private key.

On ia32, for example, all of the registers need to be available so high optimization and omitting the frame pointer needs to be taken care of. wolfSSL will add `-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer` to GCC for non debug builds. If you're using a different compiler you may need to add these manually to `CFLAGS` during configure.

OS X will also need `-mdynamic-no-pic` added to `CFLAGS`. In addition, if building in shared mode for ia32 on OS X you'll need to pass options to `LDFLAGS` as well:

```sh
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-read_only_relocs,warning"
```

This gives warnings for some symbols instead of errors.

FastMath also changes the way dynamic and stack memory are used. The normal math library uses dynamic memory for big integers. FastMath uses fixed size buffers that hold 4096 bit integers by default, allowing for 2048 bit by 2048 bit multiplications. If you need 4096 bit by 4096 bit multiplications then change `FP_MAX_BITS` in `wolfssl/wolfcrypt/tfm.h`. As `FP_MAX_BITS` is increased, this will also increase the runtime stack usage since the buffers used in the public key operations will now be larger. `FP_MAX_BITS` needs to be double the max key size. For example if your biggest key is 2048-bit, `FP_MAX_BITS` should be 4096 and if it is 4096-bit `FP_MAX_BITS` should be 8192. If using ECC only this can be reduced to the maximum ECC key size times two. A couple of functions in the library use several temporary big integers, meaning the stack can get relatively large. This should only come into play on embedded systems or in threaded environments where the stack size is set to a low value. If stack corruption occurs with FastMath during public key operations in those environments, increase the stack size to accommodate the stack usage.

If you are enabling FastMath without using the autoconf system, you’ll need to define `USE_FAST_MATH` and add `tfm.c` to the wolfSSL build while removing `integer.c`. Defining `ALT_ECC_SIZE` will allocate ECC points only from the heap instead of the stack.

##### Architecture-Specific Optimizations

The following macros can be defined for assembly optimizations with USE_FAST_MATH.

* `TFM_ARM`
* `TFM_SSE2`
* `TFM_AVR32`
* `TFM_PPC32`
* `TFM_PPC64`
* `TFM_MIPS`

##### TFM_SMALL_MONT_SET

Speed optimization for montgomery reduction of smaller numbers on Intel architectures. Includes implementations of 1-16 word Montgomery reduction. Useful for improving the performance of ECC operations.

#### Proprietary Single Precision (SP) Math Support

SP math is our recommended default option and has been taken through DO-178C certifications. Use these to speed up public key operations for specific keys sizes and curves that are common. Make sure to include the correct code files such as:

* `sp_c32.c`
* `sp_c64.c`
* `sp_arm32.c`
* `sp_arm64.c`
* `sp_armthumb.c`

## Build Options

The following are options which may be appended to the `./configure` script to customize how the wolfSSL library is built.

By default, wolfSSL only builds in shared mode, with static mode being disabled. This speeds up build times by a factor of two. Either mode can be explicitly disabled or enabled if desired.

### `--enable-debug`

Enable wolfSSL debugging support. Enabling debug support allows easier debugging by compiling with debug information and defining the constant [`DEBUG_WOLFSSL`](#debug_wolfssl) which outputs messages to `stderr`. To turn debug on at runtime, call [`wolfSSL_Debugging_ON()`](group__Debug.md#function-wolfssl_debugging_on). To turn debug logging off at runtime, call [`wolfSSL_Debugging_OFF()`](group__Debug.md#function-wolfssl_debugging_off). For more information, see [Debugging](chapter08.md#debugging).

### `--enable-distro`

Enable wolfSSL distro build.

### `--enable-singlethread`

Enable single threaded mode, no multi thread protections.

Enabling single threaded mode turns off multi thread protection of the session cache. Only enable single threaded mode if you know your application is single threaded or your application is multithreaded and only one thread at a time will be accessing the library.

### `--enable-dtls`

Enable wolfSSL DTLS support

Enabling DTLS support allows users of the library to also use the DTLS protocol in addition to TLS and SSL. For more information, see the [DTLS](chapter04.md#dtls) section.

### `--disable-rng`

Disable compiling and using RNG

### `--enable-sctp`

Enable wolfSSL DTLS-SCTP support

### `--enable-openssh`

Enable OpenSSH compatibility build

### `--enable-apachehttpd`

Enable Apache httpd compatibility build

### `--enable-openvpn`

Enable OpenVPN compatibility build

### `--enable-opensslextra`

Enable extra OpenSSL API compatibility, increases the size

Enabling OpenSSL Extra includes a larger set of OpenSSL compatibility functions. The basic build will enable enough functions for most TLS/SSL needs, but if you're porting an application that uses 10s or 100s of OpenSSL calls, enabling this will allow better support. The wolfSSL OpenSSL compatibility layer is under active development, so if there is a function missing which you need, please contact us and we'll try to help. For more information about the OpenSSL Compatibility Layer, please see [OpenSSL Compatibility](chapter13.md#openssl-compatibility).

### `--enable-opensslall`

Enable all OpenSSL API.

### `--enable-maxstrength`

Enable Max Strength build, allows TSLv1.2-AEAD-PFS ciphers only. This is
disabled by default because it can cause interoperability issues. It also
enables glitching detection.

### `--disable-harden`

Disable hardening, timing resistance and RSA blinding. Disabling this feature
can give performance improvements.

**NOTE** Hardening provides mitigations against side channel attacks. Only
disable this feature after careful consideration.

To disable via user_settings.h the equivalent settings would be:

* `#define WC_NO_CACHE_RESISTANT`
* `#define WC_NO_HARDEN`
* Remove the setting `WC_RSA_BLINDING` if present or un-define it
* Remove the setting `ECC_TIMING_RESISTANT` if present or un-define it
* Remove the setting `TFM_TIMING_RESISTANT` if present or un-define it

### `--enable-ipv6`

Enable testing of IPv6, wolfSSL proper is IP neutral

Enabling IPV6 changes the test applications to use IPv6 instead of IPv4. wolfSSL proper is IP neutral, either version can be used, but currently the test applications are IP dependent.

### `--enable-bump`

Enable SSL Bump build

### `--enable-leanpsk`

Enable Lean PSK build.

Very small build using PSK, and eliminating many features from the library. Approximate build size for wolfSSL on an embedded system with this enabled is 21kB.

### `--enable-leantls`

Implements a lean TLS 1.2 client only (no client auth), ECC256, AES128 and SHA256 w/o Shamir. Meant to be used by itself at the moment and not in conjunction with other build options.

Enabling produces a small footprint TLS client that supports TLS 1.2 client only (no client auth), ECC256, AES128 and SHA256 w/o Shamir. Meant to be used by itself at the moment and not in conjunction with other build options.

### `--enable-bigcache`

Enable a big session cache.

Enabling the big session cache will increase the session cache from 33 sessions to 20,027 sessions. The default session cache size of 33 is adequate for TLS clients and embedded servers. The big session cache is suitable for servers that aren't under heavy load, basically allowing 200 new sessions per minute or so.

### `--enable-hugecache`

Enable a huge session cache.

Enabling the huge session cache will increase the session cache size to 65,791 sessions. This option is for servers that are under heavy load, over 13,000 new sessions per minute are possible or over 200 new sessions per second.

### `--enable-smallcache`

Enable small session cache.

Enabling the small session cache will cause wolfSSL to only store 6 sessions. This may be useful for embedded clients or systems where the default of nearly 3kB is too much RAM. This define uses less than 500 bytes of RAM.

### `--enable-savesession`

Enable persistent session cache.

Enabling this option will allow an application to persist (save) and restore the wolfSSL session cache to/from memory buffers.

### `--enable-savecert`

Enable persistent cert cache.

Enabling this option will allow an application to persist (save) and restore the wolfSSL certificate cache to/from memory buffers.

### `--enable-pkcallbacks`

Enable Public Key Callbacks

### `--enable-sniffer`

Enable wolfSSL sniffer support.

Enabling sniffer (SSL inspection) support will allow the collection of SSL traffic packets as well as the ability to decrypt those packets with the correct key file.

Currently the sniffer supports the following RSA ciphers:

CBC ciphers:

* AES-CBC
* Camellia-CBC
* 3DES-CBC

Stream ciphers:

* RC4

### `--enable-aesgcm`

Enable AES-GCM support.

Eabling this option will turn on Public Key callbacks, allowing the application to register its own ECC sign/verify and RSA sign/verify and encrypt/decrypt callbacks.

### `--enable-aesccm`

Enable AES-CCM support

Enabling AES-GCM will add these cipher suites to wolfSSL.  wolfSSL offers four different implementations of AES-GCM balancing speed versus memory consumption. If available, wolfSSL will use 64-bit or 32-bit math. For embedded applications, there is a speedy 8-bit version that uses RAM-based lookup tables (8KB per session) which is speed comparable to the 64-bit version and a slower 8-bit version that doesn't take up any additional RAM. The --enable-aesgcm configure option may be modified with the options `=word32`, `=table`, or `=small`, i.e. `--enable-aesgcm=table`.

### `--disable-aescbc`

Used to with [`--disable-aescbc`](#--disable-aescbc) to compile out AES-CBC

AES-GCM will enable Counter with CBC-MAC Mode with 8‑byte authentication (CCM-8) for AES.

### `--enable-aescfb`

Turns on AES-CFB mode support

### `--enable-aesctr`

Enable wolfSSL AES-CTR support

Enabling AES-CTR will enable Counter mode.

### `--enable-aesni`

Enable wolfSSL Intel AES-NI support

Enabling AES-NI support will allow AES instructions to be called directly from the chip when using an AES-NI supported chip. This provides speed increases for AES functions.  See [Features](chapter04.md#features) for more details regarding AES-NI.

### `--enable-intelasm`

Enable ASM speedups for Intel and AMD processors.

Enabling the intelasm option for wolfSSL will utilize expanded capabilities of your processor that dramatically enhance AES performance. The instruction sets leveraged when configure option is enabled include AVX1, AVX2, BMI2, RDRAND, RDSEED, AESNI, and ADX. These were first introduced into Intel processors and AMD processors have started adopting them in recent years. When enabled, wolfSSL will check the processor and take advantage of the instruction sets your processor supports.

### `--enable-compkey`

Enable compressed keys support

### `--enable-curve25519`

Enable Curve25519 (or `--enable-curve25519=small` for CURVE25519\_SMALL).

An elliptic curve offering 128 bits of security and to be used with ECDH key  agreement (see [Cross Compiling](#cross-compiling)). Enabling curve25519 option allows for the use of the curve25519 algorithm. The default curve25519 is set to use more memory but have a faster run time. To have the algorithm use less memory the option `--enable-curve25519=small` can be used. Although using less memory there is a trade off in speed.

### `--enable-ed25519`

Enable ED25519 (or `--enable-ed25519=small` for ED25519\_SMALL)

Enabling ed25519 option allows for the use of the ed25519 algorithm. The default ed25519 is set to use more memory but have a faster run time. To have the algorithm use less memory the option `--enable-ed25519=small` can be used. Like with curve25519 using this enable option less is a trade off between speed and memory.

### `--disable-crypttests`

Disable Crypt Bench/Test

### `--enable-fast-rsa`

Enable RSA using Intel IPP.

Enabling fast-rsa speeds up RSA operations by using IPP libraries. It has a larger memory consumption then the default RSA set by wolfSSL. If IPP libraries can not be found an error message will be displayed during configuration. The first location that autoconf will look is in the directory `wolfssl_root/IPP` the second is standard location for libraries on the machine such as `/usr/lib/` on linux systems.

The libraries used for RSA operations are in the directory `wolfssl-X.X.X/IPP/` where X.X.X is the current wolfSSL version number. Building from the bundled libraries is dependent on the directory location and name of IPP so the file structure of the subdirectory IPP should not be changed.

When allocating memory the fast-rsa operations have a memory tag of `DYNAMIC_TYPE_USER_CRYPTO`. This allows for viewing the memory consumption of RSA operations during run time with the fast-rsa option.

### `--enable-staticmemory`

Enable static memory use

### `--enable-mcapi`

Enable Microchip API

### `--enable-asynccrypt`

Enable Asynchronous Crypto

### `--enable-sessionexport`

Enable export and import of sessions

### `--enable-aeskeywrap`

Enable AES key wrap support

### `--enable-jobserver`

Values: `yes` (default) / `no` / `#`

When using `make` this builds wolfSSL using a multithreaded build, `yes` (default) detects the number of CPU cores and builds using a recommended amount of jobs for that count, `#` to specify an exact number. This works in a similar way to the `make -j` option.

### `--enable-shared[=PKGS]`

Building shared wolfSSL libraries [default=yes]

Disabling the shared library build will exclude a wolfSSL shared library from being built. By default only a shared library is built in order to save time and space.

### `--enable-static[=PKGS]`

Building static wolfSSL libraries [default=no]

### `--with-liboqs=PATH`

Path to OpenQuantumSafe install (default `/usr/local`).

This turns on the ability for wolfSSL to use the experimental TLS 1.3 quantum-safe KEM groups, hybrid quantum-safe KEM groups and FALCON signature scheme via wolfSSL integration with liboqs. Please see the appendix "Experimenting with Quantum-Safe Cryptography" in this document for more details.

### `--with-libz=PATH`

Optionally include libz for compression.

Enabling libz will allow compression support in wolfSSL from the libz library. Think twice about including this option and using it by calling [`wolfSSL_set_compression()`](group__Setup.md#function-wolfssl_set_compression). While compressing data before sending decreases the actual size of the messages being sent and received, the amount of data saved by compression usually takes longer in time to analyze than it does to send it raw on all but the slowest of networks.

### `--with-cavium`

Path to cavium/software directory.

### `--with-user-crypto`

Path to USER\_CRYPTO install (default `/usr/local`).

### `--enable-rsavfy`

Enables RSA verify only support (**note** requires [`--enable-cryptonly`](#--enable-cryptonly))

### `--enable-rsapub`

Default value: Enabled RSA public key only support (**note** requires [`--enable-cryptonly`](#--enable-cryptonly))

### `--enable-armasm`

Enables ARMv8 ASM support.

The default configure sets mcpu or mfpu based on 64 vs 32 bit system. It does not overwrite mcpu or mfpu setting passed in by use of CPPFLAGS. On some compilers `-mstrict-align` may be needed due to the constraiants and `-mstrict-align` is now also set by default unless a user passes in mcpu/mfpu flags with `CPPFLAGS`.

### `--disable-tlsv12`

Disable TLS 1.2 support

### `--enable-tls13`

Enable TLS 1.3 support

This build option can be combined with [`--disable-tlsv12`](#--disable-tlsv12) and [`--disable-oldtls`](#--disable-oldtlx) to produce a wolfSSL build that is only TLS 1.3.

### `--enable-all`

Enables all wolfSSL features, excluding SSL v3

### `--enable-xts`

Enables AES-XTS mode

### `--enable-asio`

Enables ASIO.

Requires that the options [`--enable-opensslextra`](#--enable-opensslextra) and [`--enable-opensslall`](#--enable-opensslall) be enabled when configuring wolfSSL. If these two options are not enabled, then the autoconf tool will automatically enable these options to enable ASIO when configuring wolfSSL.

### `--enable-qt`

Enables Qt 5.12 onwards support.

Enables wolfSSL build settings compatible with the wolfSSL Qt port. Patch file is required from wolfSSL for patching Qt source files.

### `--enable-qt-test`

Enable Qt test compatibility build.

Enables support for building wolfSSL for compatibility with running the built-in Qt tests.

### `--enable-apache-httpd`

Enables Apache httpd support

### `--enable-afalg`

Enables use of Linux module AF\_ALG for hardware accleration. Additional Xilinx use with `=xilinx`, `=xilinx-rsa`, `=xilinx-aes`, `=xilinx-sha3`

Is similar to [`--enable-devcrypto`](#--enable-devcrypto) in that it leverages a Linux kernel module (AF\_ALG) for offloading crypto operations. On some hardware the module has performance accelerations available through the Linux crypto drivers. In the case of Petalinux with Xilinx the flag `--enable-afalg=xilinx` can be used to tell wolfSSL to use the Xilinx interface for AF\_ALG.

### `--enable-devcrypto`

Enables use of Linux `/dev/crypto` for hardware acceleration.

Has the ability to receive arguments, being able to receive any combination of `aes` (all aes support), `hash` (all hash algorithms), and `cbc` (aes-cbc only). If no options are given, it will default to using `all`.

### `--enable-mcast`

Enable wolfSSL DTLS multicast support

### `--disable-pkcs12`

Disable PKCS12 code

### `--enable-fallback-scsv`

Enables Signaling Cipher Suite Value(SCSV)

### `--enable-psk-one-id`

Enables support for single PSK ID with TLS 1.3

### `--enable-cryptocb`

Enable crypto callbacks. Register a crypto callback using wc_CryptoCb_RegisterDevice and set the associated devId using wolfSSL_CTX_SetDevId.

The following two defines can be used with `--enable-cryptocb` to complie out RSA or ECC software fallback to optimize for footprint reduction when software RSA/ECC is not required.

* WOLF_CRYPTO_CB_ONLY_RSA - compiles out RSA software crypto fallback
* WOLF_CRYPTO_CB_ONLY_ECC - compiles out ECC software crypto fallback

Use of the WOLF_CRYPTO_CB_ONLY_* options requires disabling the examples. See [`--disable-examples`](#disable-examples)

### `--enable-reproducible-build`

Suppresses the binary jitter (timestamps and other non-functional metadata) to allow generation of bitwise-identical binary packages with identical hashes.

### `--enable-sys-ca-certs`
Allows wolfSSL to use trusted system CA certificates for verification when [`wolfSSL_CTX_load_system_CA_certs()`](group__CertsKeys.html#function-wolfssl_ctx_load_system_ca_certs) is called, either by loading them into wolfSSL certificate manager, or by invoking system authentication APIs. See [`wolfSSL_CTX_load_system_CA_certs()`](group__CertsKeys.html#function-wolfssl_ctx_load_system_ca_certs) for more details.

## Special Math Optimization Flags

### `--enable-fastmath`

Enable FastMath implementation. Both FastMath and Big Integer library are disabled if Single-Precision (SP) math is enabled.

See USE_FAST_MATH and Big Integer Math Library sections.

### `--enable-fasthugemath`

Enable fast math + huge code.

Enabling fasthugemath includes support for the FastMath library and greatly increases the code size by unrolling loops for popular key sizes during public key operations. Try using the benchmark utility before and after using fasthugemath to see if the slight speedup is worth the increased code size.

### `--enable-sp-math`

Enable Single-Precision (SP) math implementation with restricted algorithm suite. Unsupported algorithms are disabled. Overrides `--enable-sp`, `--enable-sp-math-all`, `--enable-fastmath` and `--enable-fasthugemath`.

- Replaces the math implementation with that in sp_int.c
- A minimal implementation, turns on portions of sp_int.c but not all.
- MUST combine with --enable-sp to turn on the solutions in sp_x86_64.c or sp_arm.c etc (list of files below depending on the target system) to be able to perform RSA/ECC/DH operations.
- Not to be combined with --enable-sp-math-all (below)

FILE LIST (platform dependent, chosen by configure based on system specs or can
be manually controlled when using a Makefile/IDE solution):
sp_arm32.c
sp_arm64.c
sp_armthumb.c
sp_cortexm.c
sp_dsp32.c
sp_x86_64.c
sp_x86_64_asm.S
sp_x86_64_asm.asm

### `--enable-sp-math-all`

Enabled by default. Enable Single-Precision (SP) math implementation with full algorithm suite. Unsupported algorithms are enabled, but unoptimized. Overrides `--enable-sp`, `--enable-fastmath` and `--enable-fasthugemath`.

- Replaces the math implementation with that in sp_int.c
- A FULL implementation, does not depend on --enable-sp to work
- Can be combined with --enable-sp to allow use of the implementations written in portable c assembly (non-hardware specific assembly) in sp_c32.c for 32-bit or sp_c64.c for 64-bit when possible. The rest of the time (when not possible) the implementations in sp_int.c are used. The portable C assembly gives significant performance gains on targets that do not have hardware optimizations available.
- Not to be combined with --enable-sp-math (above)

**NOTE**: If you are using asymmetric cryptography with key length in bits [256, 384, 521, 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096], you should consider using --enable-sp-math option to get maximum performance with a larger footprint size.

### `--enable-sp-asm`

Enable Single-Precision (SP) assembly implementation.

Can be used to enable Single-Precision performance improvements through assembly with Intel x86\_64 and ARM architectures.

### `--enable-sp=OPT`

Enable Single-Precision (SP) math for RSA, DH, and ECC to improve performance.

There are many possible values for OPT. Below is a list of ways to call enable-sp and the resulting macros that will be defined as a result. All of these can be combined in a coma separated list. For example, `--enable-sp=ec256,ec384`. The meaning of the macros that will be defined are defined above in the [wolfSSL’s Proprietary Single Precision (SP) Math Support] section.

**NOTE**:
1) "--enable-sp=small --enable-sp-math" can be smaller than...
2) "--enable-sp-math-all=small"...
as (1) only has implementations of specific key sizes while (2) has implementations to support all key sizes.

**NOTE**: This is for x86_64 and with no other configuration flags; your results may vary depending on your architectures and other configuration flags that you specify. For example,  WOLFSSL_SP_384 and WOLFSSL_SP_4096 will only be enabled for Intel x86_64.

## Cross Compiling

Many users on embedded platforms cross compile wolfSSL for their environment. The easiest way to cross compile the library is to use the `./configure` system. It will generate a Makefile which can then be used to build wolfSSL.

When cross compiling, you’ll need to specify the host to `./configure`, such as:

```sh
./configure --host=arm-linux
```

You may also need to specify the compiler, linker, etc. that you want to use:

```sh
./configure --host=arm-linux CC=arm-linux-gcc AR=arm-linux-ar RANLIB=arm-linux
```

There is a bug in the configure system which you might see when cross compiling and detecting user overriding malloc. If you get an undefined reference to `rpl_malloc` and/or `rpl_realloc`, please add the following to your `./configure` line:

```sh
ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes ac_cv_func_realloc_0_nonnull=yes
```

After correctly configuring wolfSSL for cross-compilation, you should be able to follow standard autoconf practices for building and installing the library:

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

If you have any additional tips or feedback about cross compiling wolfSSL, please let us know at [info@wolfssl.com](mailto:info@wolfssl.com).

## Building Ports

wolfSSL has been ported to many environments and devices. A portion of these ports and accompanying documentation for them is located in the directory `wolfssl-X.X.X/IDE`, where X.X.X is the current wolfSSL version number. This directory also contains helpful information and code for IDE’s used to build wolfSSL for the environments.

PORT Lists:

* Arduino
* LPCXPRESSO
* Wiced Studio
* CSBench
* SGX Windows and Linux
  * These directories (`wolfssl/IDE/WIN-SGX` and `wolfssl/IDE/LINUX-SGX`) contain Makefiles for and Visual Studio solutions for building wolfSSL as a library to be used in an Intel SGX project.
* Hexagon
  * This directory (`wolfssl/IDE/HEXAGON`) contains a Makefile for building with the Hexagon tool chain. It can be used to build wolfSSL for offloading ECC verify operations to a DSP processor. The directory contains a README file to help with the steps required to build.

## Building For NXP CAAM

### i.MX8 (Linux)

#### Known Issues
- If exiting an open HSM key store session before closing up the HSM session (wc_SECO_CloseHSM and wolfSSL_CLeanup or wolfCrypt_Cleanup) the next time the NVM is started up it segfaults. A power cycle is needed to work around it.

#### Limitations Found
- AES operations with large inputs (i.e. 1 megabyte) fails with the SECO getting “Not enough space in shared memory”.
- After creating 2 keystores the attempt to create a 3rd will fail. To reset the keystores do rm -rf /etc/seco_hsm and power cycle the device.

#### Intro
On i.MX8 devices there is a SECO hardware module available for heightened security. This module handles AES operations and key storage, limited ECC operations and key storage, and provides a RNG. wolfSSL has been expanded to make use of the SECO where possible. For some algorithms the CAAM on i.MX8 supports them but the SECO module does not yet. In these cases wolfSSL will make calls through /dev/crypto down to a Linux CAAM driver that creates jobs for the CAAM directly. There are some algorithms supported by default with the NXP Linux CAAM driver but not all algorithms that the CAAM supports. wolfSSL has expanded the Linux CAAM driver to add support for additional algorithms. To use both avenues of accessing the CAAM from the same application the “devId” associated with the different code paths can be set, either WOLFSSL_CAAM_DEVID or WOLFSSL_SECO_DEVID. These IDs are used when first initializing a structure to set which code path will be used throughout the lifetime of the structure. If using software only then the default INVALID_DEVID should be set. The exception to this is SECO items that do not use the key store; TRNG, and Hashing.


Versions of software used:

- imx-seco-libs branch imx_5.4.24_2.1.0
- NXP “repo” tool and Yocto build. Documentation on Yocto setup is here
- wolfSSL 5.2.0 + (was developed after 5.2.0 release)


#### Supported Algorithms
Supported algorithms, modes, and operations include:

- AES (ECB, CBC, CCM, GCM)
- AES CMAC
- SHA256, SHA384
- ECC 256/384 (keygen, sign, verify, ecdh)
- RSA 3072 (keygen, sign, verify)
- HMAC
- Curve25519
- TRNG


#### Building Image
##### “repo” Setup
Setting up the NXP “repo” command tool was done on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\

```
sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib
sudo apt-get install build-essential chrpath socat cpio python python3 python3-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-pexpect xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping python3-git
sudo apt-get install python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa libsdl1.2-dev pylint3 xterm curl
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
```


```
mkdir ~/bin
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

git config --global user.name "Your Git Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"
```


As of Jan 11, 2022 GitHub is no longer allowing unauthenticated git connections. NXP’s repo tool has not yet taken this into account at the time that this document was created (March, 2022). To work around this redirect git://github.com/ to https://github.com/ with the following command:


```
git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git://github.com/
```


Make the desired directory to build in, for example:

```
mkdir imx-yocto-bsp
cd imx-yocto-bsp/
```

After setting up NXP’s “repo” command tool, initialize and sync a directory with the desired version of Linux. In this case 5.4.24_2.1.0.\

```
repo init -u https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/imx-manifest -b imx-linux-zeus -m imx-5.4.24-2.1.0.xml
repo sync

DISTRO=fsl-imx-wayland MACHINE=imx8qxpc0mek source imx-setup-release.sh -b build-xwayland
```

##### Additional Yocto CAAM Layers
Next download the CAAM driver expansion layers that will apply patches to cryptodev-module, cryptodev-linux, and to files in `linux-imx/drivers/crypto/caam/*`. The base blob and ECDSA (sign/verify/keygen) is located here (https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imxsupport/imx_sec_apps/). The layer that expands that farther to have RSA black key, ECDH, and Curve25519 support is meta-imx-expand-caam. Place both of these directories into the sources directory next to the other existing meta-\* directories.


```sh
#<assuming in the build-xwayland directory from previous command>

#<either clone the current work or open from a delivered zip>
git clone -b caam_expansion https://github.com/JacobBarthelmeh/imx_sec_apps
cp -r imx_sec_apps/meta-imx-ecdsa-sec ../sources/
cp -r imx_sec_apps/meta-imx-expand-caam ../sources/


# or

git clone https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imxsupport/imx_sec_apps.git
#(meta-imx-expand-caam comes from wolfSSL)
unzip meta-imx-expand-caam.zip

cp -r imx_sec_apps/meta-imx-ecdsa-sec ../sources/
mv meta-imx-expand-caam ../sources/
```


Add those layers to the build, ecdsa first, then the CAAM expansion.

```
vim conf/bblayers.conf
BBLAYERS += "${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-imx-ecdsa-sec"
BBLAYERS += "${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-imx-expand-caam"
```


Add the desired modules and libraries to the local conf file.

```sh
vim conf/local.conf
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES_append = " dev-pkgs tools-sdk tools-debug ssh-server-openssh "
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " cryptodev-module cryptodev-linux eckey "
```


In this build, we had added debugging tools and an SSH server, which are not necessary if looking to trim down on size. The important items to add are “cryptodev-module and cryptodev-linux”. “eckey” is a demo tool from NXP for encapsulating and decapsulating blobs.

[Optional]
To add the auto loading of cryptodev module add the following line to conf/local.conf.


```
KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "cryptodev"
```


Otherwise the module will need to be loaded after each power cycle using “modprobe cryptodev”.


##### Build and Deploy
To kick off the build of the image use the following command. Then if using an sdcard, flash it to the card.


```
bitbake core-image-base

cd tmp/deploy/images/imx8qxpc0mek/
bzcat core-image-base-imx8qxpc0mek.sdcard.bz2 | sudo dd of=/dev/diskX bs=5m
```


Note: 5m is for Mac OS, use 5M for Linux. diskX should be replaced with the location of sdcard, i.e. disk2 on Mac or sdbX on Linux. Check to make sure of the sdcard disk number before executing.
For use with building wolfssl/examples later export the install directory using the following:

```
export　CRYPTODEV_DIR=`pwd`/tmp/sysroots-components/aarch64/cryptodev-linux/usr/include/
```


To install the toolchain for cross compiling use the following Yocto command

```
bitbake meta-toolchain
sudo ./tmp/deploy/sdk/<version>.sh
```

#### Building NXP HSM
##### Build zlib
Multiple ways to do this, one is to add it to the Yocto build one way is to build it using bitbake as follows.


```
cd build-xwayland
bitbake zlib
```


This places the results into the directory tmp/sysroots-components/aarch64/zlib/usr/

For use with building wolfssl/examples later export the install directory using the following:

```
export ZLIB_DIR=`pwd`/tmp/sysroots-components/aarch64/zlib/usr/
```

##### Build NXP HSM lib
Download the NXP HSM library, and adjust the Makefile (or environment variables) in order to find the necessary zlib.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NXP/imx-seco-libs.git
cd imx-seco-libs
git checkout imx_5.4.24_2.1.0
```


```sh
vim Makefile


CFLAGS = -O1 -Werror -fPIC -I$(ZLIB_DIR)/include -L$(ZLIB_DIR)/lib
```


then

```
make
make install
```

For use with building wolfssl/examples later export the install directory using the following:


```sh
export HSM_DIR=`pwd`/export/usr/
```

Make install places the results in the subdirectory “export” by default.


#### Building wolfSSL

##### Building Using Autoconf

If setting up the Yocto image with development tools then wolfSSL can be built directly on the system. For a more minimalistic approach cross compiling can be used. Debug messages can be enabled with –enable-debug. Extra debug messages specific to the SECO work can be enabled by defining the macro DEBUG_SECO and for the /dev/crypto calls DEBUG_DEVCRYPTO. The extra debug messages for both make use of printf, outputting on the stdout pipe.
There are a couple key enable options for use with SECO. --enable-caam=seco, --enable-devcrypto=seco, --with-seco=/hsm-lib/export.


Example build with HSM SECO only (no devcrypto support for additional algorithms)


```sh
source /opt/fsl-imx-wayland/5.4-zeus/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux

# Install dependencies for building wolfSSL
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool

./autogen.sh
./configure --host=aarch64-poky-linux --with-libz=$ZLIB_DIR --with-seco=$HSM_DIR \ --enable-caam=seco --enable-cmac --enable-aesgcm --enable-aesccm --enable-keygen \
CPPFLAGS="-DHAVE_AES_ECB"
make
```

Example building with HSM SECO and additional devcrypto support. The include path to crypto/cryptodev.h needs to be set.


```sh
./configure --host=aarch64-poky-linux --with-libz=$ZLIB_DIR --with-seco=$HSM_DIR \
--enable-caam=seco --enable-cmac --enable-aesgcm --enable-aesccm --enable-keygen \
CPPFLAGS="-DHAVE_AES_ECB -I$CRYPTODEV_DIR" --enable-devcrypto=seco \
--enable-curve25519
make
```


There are fail safes to error out early on wolfCrypt_Init / wolfSSL_Init function calls. One case is if the cryptodev module has not been loaded or does not have the support available for the desired operations. The other case where the init operation would fail is if the NXP HSM was not able to be set up. If the application is failing on initialization, adding --enable-debug to the wolfSSL build and the function call wolfSSL_Debugging_ON() before the initialization of wolfSSL will print out useful debug messages about why it is failing.


Example building with debug options turned on


```sh
./configure --host=aarch64-poky-linux --with-libz=$ZLIB_DIR --with-seco=$HSM_DIR \
--enable-caam=seco --enable-cmac --enable-aesgcm --enable-aesccm --enable-keygen \
CPPFLAGS="-DHAVE_AES_ECB -I$CRYPTODEV_DIR -DDEBUG_SECO -DDEBUG_DEVCRYPTO" \
--enable-devcrypto=seco --enable-curve25519
```

#### API

##### API Added

***List of additional API added***

- void wc_SECO_AesSetKeyID(Aes* aes, int keyId);
This function is used to set a SECO key ID into an Aes structure. It should be called after the Aes structure has been initialized and before the structure gets used for encrypt/decrypt operations.
- int wc_SECO_AesGetKeyID(Aes* aes);
A getter function for the SECO key ID set in the Aes structure.
- void wc_SECO_CMACSetKeyID(Cmac* cmac, int keyId);
Similar to wc_SECO_AesSetKeyID but for Cmac structures.
- int wc_SECO_CMACGetKeyID(Cmac* cmac);
Getter function for the SECO key ID set in the Cmac structure.
- int wc_SECO_OpenHSM(word32 keyStoreId, word32 nonce, word16 maxUpdates, byte flag);
This function should be called before doing any operations that require the keystore. Such as ECC or AES operations. The first argument is the keystore ID, “nonce” is the specific 32bit sequence used when creating and unlocking an already existing keystore, “maxUpdates” sets the max number of times the key store can be updated, “flag” is used for optional flags and takes in whether or not the key store is being created. To create the HSM keystore the flag should be CAAM_KEYSTORE_CREATE otherwise to open an existing keystore or update it the flag should be CAAM_KEYSTORE_UPDATE.
- int wc_SECO_CloseHSM(void);
This function must be called when done with the keystore and before calling wolfCrypt_Cleanup/wolfSSL_Cleanup. It closes down the currently open keystore.
- int wc_SECO_GenerateKey(int flags, int group, byte* out, int outSz, int keyType, int keyInfo, unsigned int* keyIdOut);\
This function can be used for generating new keys in the SECO. For key generation the flag should be CAAM_GENERATE_KEY. For updating a key the flag should be CAAM_UPDATE_KEY. The keyIdOut argument is an in/out argument that gets populated on key creation and should be set as an input on key update. In the case of updating a key it should be a transient type and the group should be set to 0 for updating. Transient type is set as the keyInfo arg, possible options for keyInfo and KeyTypes are;
    - CAAM_KEY_TRANSIENT (keyInfo)
    - CAAM_KEY_PERSISTENT (keyInfo)
    - CAAM_KEYTYPE_ECDSA_P256 (keyType)
    - CAAM_KEYTYPE_ECDSA_P384 (keyType)
    - CAAM_KEYTYPE_AES128 (keyType)
- int wc_SECO_DeleteKey(unsigned int keyId, int group, int keyTypeIn);
Used to delete a key from the keystore.

##### Native wolfSSL API With CAAM Support

This is a list of native wolfSSL API that now have CAAM support with the SECO build outlined in this documentation.



For generation of any AES encrypt and decrypt operations the key can be generated using the following process. Using wc_SECO_GenerateKey(CAAM_GENERATE_KEY, groupID, pubOut, 0, CAAM_KEYTPE_AES128, CAAM_KEY_PERSISTENT, &keyIdOut); where groupID is a specified group number and pubOut is a 32 byte buffer, and the variable keyIdOut gets set to a the new key ID generated. This new key ID generated can then be set in an Aes structure using wc_SECO_AesSetKeyID(Aes, keyIdOut); . Once the key ID has been set in the structure and the Aes structure has been initialized as a WOLFSSL_SECO_DEVID type it will use that key ID for all encrypt and decrypt operations.

###### ***AES (ECB/CBC)***

Alternatively to generate AES ECB/CBC keys, if the Aes structure has been initialized with WOLFSSL_SECO_DEVID the function wc_AesSetKey can be called with a plain text key passed to it. The API wc_AesSetKey will then try to encrypt the key using the unique KEK and import it into the SECO HSM. If imported successfully, the value of 0 will be returned and the key ID will be set in the Aes structure.


- CBC encrypt would be done with wc_AesCbcEncrypt, decrypt with wc_AesCbcDecrypt.
- ECB encrypt would be done with wc_AesEcbEncrypt, decrypt with wc_AesEcbDecrypt.


Once finished with the Aes structure it must be free’d using wc_AesFree(Aes); .

###### ***AES-GCM***

- GCM encrypt would be done with wc_AesGcmEncrypt, decrypt with wc_AesGcmDecrypt.


The AES-GCM encrypt function takes in the Aes structure, output buffer, input buffer, input buffer size, nonce, nonce size (required to be 12 bytes), MAC or known as tag, tag size (required to be 16 bytes), additional data, additional data size (4 bytes). On encryption the input buffer is encrypted and the tag buffer is filled with a created MAC.

For AES-GCM decrypt the function takes in the Aes structure, plain text output buffer, cipher text input buffer, input buffer size, nonce, nonce size (12 bytes), previously created tag from encryption call, tag buffer size, additional data, additional data size. On decryption the tag buffer is checked to verify the message's integrity.

Once finished with the Aes structure it must be free’d using wc_AesFree(Aes); .

###### ***AES-CCM***

- CCM encrypt would be done with wc_AesCcmEncrypt, decrypt with wc_AesCcmDecrypt.


The AES-CCM encrypt function takes in the Aes structure, output buffer, input buffer, input buffer size, nonce, nonce size (required to be 12 bytes), MAC or known as tag, tag size (required to be 16 bytes), additional data, additional data size (0 bytes). The additional data buffer should be NULL and a size of 0 is required with the NXP HSM library. On encryption the input buffer is encrypted and the tag buffer is filled with a created MAC.
\
For AES-CCM decrypt the function takes in the Aes structure, plain text output buffer, cipher text input buffer, input buffer size, nonce, nonce size (12 bytes), previously created tag from encryption call, tag buffer size, additional data, additional data size. Similar to the encrypt function the additional data buffer should be NULL. On decryption the tag buffer is checked to verify the message's integrity.
\
Once finished with the Aes structure it must be free’d using wc_AesFree(Aes); .
\

###### ***AES CMAC***

For AES CMAC operations the AES key can be generated using wc_SECO_GenerateKey(CAAM_GENERATE_KEY, groupID, pubOut, 0, CAAM_KEYTPE_AES128, CAAM_KEY_PERSISTENT, &keyIdOut); where groupID is a specified group number and pubOut is a 32 byte buffer, and the variable keyIdOut gets set to a the new key ID generated. This new key ID generated can then be set in an Aes structure using wc_SECO_CMACSetKeyID(Cmac, keyIdOut); . Once the key ID has been set in the structure and the Aes structure has been initialized as a WOLFSSL_SECO_DEVID type it will use that key ID for all encrypt and decrypt operations.

Since the HSM library is a single shot type, each call to wc_CmacUpdate stores up the input into an internal buffer. Then once wc_CmacFinal is called the whole buffer is passed on to the hardware for creating the MAC.


###### ***RSA***

RSA operations make use of the cryptodev-linux module. This includes support for AES-ECB encrypted black private keys, which is the default when initialized with WOLFSSL_CAAM_DEVID.

Example of native wolfSSL API that would be used with the cryptodev-linux module is as follows:


```lang-c
wc_InitRsaKey_ex(key, heap-hint (can be NULL), WOLFSSL_CAAM_DEVID);
wc_MakeRsaKey(key, 3072, WC_RSA_EXPONENT, &rng);
wc_RsaSSL_Sign or wc_RsaPublicEncrypt
wc_RsaSSL_Verify or wc_RsaPrivateDecrypt
wc_FreeRsaKey(key)
```

###### ***ECC***

ECC sign and verify operations can use either the cryptodev-linux module or the NXP HSM library. ECDH operations for creating a shared secret can only be done with the cryptodev-linux module.

For use with SECO (using the NXP HSM library) the dev ID flag of WOLFSSL_SECO_DEVID should be used when initializing the ecc_key structure. For use with the cryptodev-linux module the dev ID flag WOLFSSL_CAAM_DEVID should be used. After initialization with the function wc_ecc_init_ec(key, heap-hint (can be NULL), dev ID); then both use cases follow the same function native wolfSSL function calls for sign and verify.

Example function calls after initialization of the ecc_key structure would be:


> ```lang-c
> wc_ecc_make_key(&rng, ECC_P256_KEYSIZE, key);
> wc_ecc_sign_hash(hash, hashSz, sigOut, sigOutSz, &rng, key);
> wc_ecc_verify_hash(sig, sigSz, hash, hashSz, &result, key);
> ```


And with the cryptodev-linux module (WOLFSSL_CAAM_DEVID) the ECDH function can be used:


```lang-c
wc_ecc_shared_secret(keyA, keyB, sharedSecret, sharedSecretSz);
```

###### ***Hash (Sha256, Sha384, HMAC)***

SHA256 and SHA384 operations use the NXP HSM library. HMAC operations make use of the cryptodev-linux module.

By default SHA operations try to make use of the NXP HSM library, but explicitly set them to the dev ID WOLFSSL_SECO_DEVID can be used.


```lang-c
wc_InitSha256_ex(sha256, heap-hint, WOLFSSL_SECO_DEVID);
wc_InitSha384_ex(sha384, heap-hint, WOLFSSL_SECO_DEVID);
```

Because the NXP HSM library supports a single shot operation for hashing, each call to “update” will store the buffer until a “final” function is called and then pass the whole buffer on to the hardware for creating the hash digest.

Where HMAC makes use of the cryptodev-linux the Hmac structure should be initialized using the dev ID WOLFSSL_CAAM_DEVID.


```lang-c
wc_HmacInit(hmac, heap-hint, WOLFSSL_CAAM_DEVID);
```


It then can be used like it typically would be with native wolfSSL API:

```lang-c
wc_HmacSetKey(hmac, hash-type, key, keySz);
wc_HmacUpdate(hmac, input, inputSz);
wc_HmacFinal(hmac, digestOut);
```

###### ***Curve25519***

Curve25519 point multiplication is done using the cryptodev-linux module and should be initialized with the dev ID WOLFSSL_CAAM_DEVID for use with the hardware.

Example API calls would be as follows:


```lang-c
wc_curve25519_init_ex(key, heap-hint, WOLFSSL_CAAM_DEVID);
wc_curve25519_make_key(&rng, CURVE25519_KEYSIZE,  key);
wc_curve25519_shared_secret(key, keyB, sharedSecretOut, sharedSecretOutSz);
```

###### ***RNG***

TRNG for seeding the wolfSSL HASH-DRBG makes use of the NXP HSM library. This is compiled in to the wolfcrypt/src/random.c file when wolfSSL is built with --enable-caam=seco. All RNG initializations in wolfSSL will make use of the TRNG for seeding. Standard RNG API calls would be as follows:


```lang-c
wc_InitRng(rng);
wc_RNG_GenerateBlock(rng, output, outputSz);
wc_FreeRng(rng);
```

### i.MX8 (QNX)

<Documentation available, not inserted here yet @TODO>

### i.MX6 (QNX)

<Documentation available, not inserted here yet @TODO>

### IMXRT1170 (FreeRTOS)

Example IDE Setup for use with IMXRT1170 can be found in the directory IDE/MCUEXPRESSO/RT1170


#### Build Steps

- Open MCUEXPRESSO and set the workspace to wolfssl/IDE/MCUEXPRESSO/RT1170
- File -> Open Projects From File System... -> Directory : and set the browse to wolfssl/IDE/MCUEXPRESSO/RT1170 directory then click "select directory"
- Select wolfssl_cm7, wolfcrypt_test_cm7, CSR_example, PKCS7_example
- Right click the projects -> SDK Management -> Refresh SDK Components and click "yes"
- increase the size of configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in FreeRTOSConfig.h to be 60240 for CSR and PKCS7 example and around 100000 for wolfcrypt_test_cm7
- (note board files need to be recreated .... this can be done by creating a new project that has the same settings and copying over the generated board/* files)
- Build the projects


#### Expanding RT1170 CAAM Driver

The files RT1170/fsl_caam_h.patch and RT1170/fsl_caam_c.patch include changes to
the existing NXP CAAM driver for use with creating/opening Blobs and generating
and using ECC black keys.

To apply the patches first create a project that has the caam driver. This will
generate the base fsl_caam.c and fsl_caam.h in the drivers directory. (i.e PKCS7_example_cm7/drivers/fls_caam.{c,h})
. Once the base files are generated then 'cd' to the drivers directory and apply
the patch (cd PKCS7_example_cm7/drivers/ && patch -p1 < ../../fsl_caam_c.patch && patch -p1 < ../../fsl_caam_h.patch)

In the patch for fsl_caam.h there are macros defined for both the ECC and Blob
expansion (CAAM_ECC_EXPANSION and CAAM_BLOB_EXPANSION). When wolfSSL code finds
that these macros are defined (the patch has been applied) then it tries to
compile in use of the expanded driver.
