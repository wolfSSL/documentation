# Experimenting with Post-Quantum Cryptography

A while back, the wolfSSL team integrated experimental post-quantum cryptographic algorithms into the wolfSSL library. This was done by integrating with the Open Quantum Safe team's liboqs. Currently, wolfCrypt implements LMS, XMSS, ML-DSA and ML-KEM. So, for the purpose of code size reduction and ease of maintence, the wolfSSL team removed the integration with liboqs.

This appendix is intended for anyone that wants to start learning about post-quantum cryptography in the context of (D)TLS 1.3. It explains why post-quantum algorithms are important, what we have done in response to the quantum threat and how you can start experimenting with these new algorithms.

**Note**: Some of the post-quantum algorithms are not fully standardized yet. Some OIDs and codepoints are temporary and expected to change in the future. You should have no expectation of backwards compatibility until they are fully standardized.

## A Gentle Introduction to Post-Quantum Cryptography

### Why Post-Quantum Cryptography?

For some time now, many resources have been devoted to the development of quantum computers. So much so that commercialization of cloud quantum computing resources has already begun. While the current state of the art is still not in the realm of being cryptographically relevant, some threat models such as "harvest now, decrypt later" mean that preparations need to happen sooner than the appearance of cryptographically relevant quantum computers.

NIST is leading the way for standardization of a new class of algorithms designed to replace the public key cryptography algorithms that will become vulnerable to quantum computers. At the time of the writing of this passage, NIST has already standardized ML-DSA, ML-KEM, and SLH-DSA. Currently, standards organizations have various draft documents describing OIDs and codepoints. NIST is working on bringing these algorithms under the ubmbrella of the CMVP regulatory framework allowing for FIPS-140-3 validations of implementations of these algorithms.

### How do we Protect Ourselves?

From a high level perspective, for every TLS 1.3 connection, authentication, integrity and confidentiality are the main security goals that protect each connection. Authentication is maintained via signature schemes such as ECDSA. Confidentiality and integrity are maintained by key establishment algorithms such as ECDHE and then using the established key with symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES to encrypt a communication stream. We can thus decompose the security of the TLS 1.3 protocol into 3 types of cryptographic algorithms:

* authentication algorithms
* key establishment algorithms
* symmetric cipher algorithms

The threat of quantum computers to conventional cryptography takes two forms. Grover’s algorithm reduces the security of modern symmetric cipher algorithms by approximately half while Shor’s algorithm completely breaks the security of modern authentication and key establishment algorithms. As a result, we can continue to protect our communications using the AES-256 symmetric cipher which is considered sufficiently secure even in the presence of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer. We can then replace our conventional authentication and key establishment algorithms with post-quantum algorithms. Note that during TLS 1.3 handshakes, the ciphersuite specifies the symmetric cipher to be used for the duration of the connection. Both CNSA (Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite) 1.0 and 2.0 prescribe using the AES_256_GCM_SHA384 ciphersuite. For key establishment and authentication, there are post-quantum KEMs (Key Encapsulation Mechanisms) and signature schemes.

These use different kinds of math from the conventional algorithms. They are designed specifically for resistance to quantum-computers. The authentication algorithm and KEM that NIST has standardized for use with network protocols are lattice-based algorithms.

* ML-DSA (Dilithium) Signature Scheme
* ML-KEM (KYBER) KEM

**Note**: SABER KEM and NTRU KEM were deprecated and removed as they did not
          move on to standardization.

**Note**: KYBER KEM 90s variants were deprecated and removed as NIST is not
          considering them for standardization.

**Note**: Dilithium Signature Scheme's AES variants were deprecated and removed
          as NIST is not considering them for standardization.

**Note**: When the liboqs integration was removed, we also removed the FALCON
          and SPHINCS+ signature schemes. We will have our own implmentations
          in the future.

An explanation of lattice-based cryptography would fall outside the scope of this document but more information about these algorithms can be found in their NIST submissions at <https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions>.

Unfortunately, it might come as a shock, but we do not actually know that these algorithms will resist attacks from quantum computers. In fact, we do not even know that these algorithms are safe against a conventional computer. Its getting less and less likely, but someone could break lattice-based cryptography. However, as security experts will tell you, this is how cryptography has always worked. Algorithms are good when we start using them, but weaknesses and vulnerabilities are discovered and technology gets better. The post-quantum algorithms are somewhat problematic in that they are relatively new and could use a bit more attention from the community.

One solution is to not put our full faith into these new algorithms. For now, we can hedge our bets by hybridizing post-quantum algorithms with the conventional algorithms that we actually trust. ECC with NIST standardized curves seem like good candidates as we have to keep using them since FIPS 140-3 compliance is a priority. For this reason, we have not only implemented post-quantum KEMs but also hybridized them with ECDSA over NIST approved curves. Please see our list of hybrid groups below.

## Getting Started with Post-Quantum algorithms in wolfSSL

The following instructions will get you started from a clean Linux development environment and lead you step by step to performing a quantum-safe TLS 1.3 connection.

### Build Instructions

Please see the wolfSSL repo's INSTALL file (https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/INSTALL). Item 15 has instructions on how to configure and build wolfSSL with ML-KEM and ML-DSA enabled.

You will need the patched OQS OpenSSL Provider fork in order to generate X.509 certificates with post-quantum cryptographic keys and signatures. Instructions can be found at https://github.com/wolfSSL/osp/tree/master/oqs/README.md. For your convenience, pre-generated certificates can be found there as well.

### Making a Quantum Safe TLS Connection

You can run the server and client like this in separate terminals:

```sh
    $ examples/server/server -v 4 -l TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 \
      -A certs/mldsa87_root_cert.pem \
      -c certs/mldsa44_entity_cert.pem \
      -k certs/mldsa44_entity_key.pem \
      --pqc P521_ML_KEM_1024
```

```sh
    $ examples/client/client -v 4 -l TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 \
      -A certs/mldsa44_root_cert.pem \
      -c certs/mldsa87_entity_cert.pem \
      -k certs/mldsa87_entity_key.pem \
      --pqc P521_ML_KEM_1024
```

You have just achieved a fully quantum-safe TLS 1.3 connection using AES-256 for symmetric encryption, the ML-DSA signature scheme for authentication and ECDHE hybridized with ML-KEM for key establishment.

## Statistics

The following statistics and benchmarks were taken on an 11th GenIntel Core i7-1185G7@3-GHz with 8 cores running Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS

wolfSSL:

```text
./configure --enable-kyber \
            --enable-dilithium \
            --disable-psk \
            --disable-shared \
            --enable-intelasm \
            --enable-aesni \
            --enable-sp-math-all \
            --enable-sp-asm \
            CFLAGS="-Os"
```

**Note**: We are primarily benchmarking the post-quantum algorithms, but leave some conventional algorithms for comparison purposes.

### Runtime Binary Sizes

The `tls_bench` example application binary file is 2498432 bytes after being built then stripped (Approximately 2.4M).  Without `--enable-kyber --enable-dilithium` it is 2290912 bytes after being built then stripped (Approximately 2.2M). This is a difference of 207520 bytes (Approximately 200K).

### TLS 1.3 Data Transmission Sizes

The following results were taken by running the example server and client and recording all information being transmitted via wireshark. This includes the TLS 1.3 handshake with mutual authentication, "hello wolfssl!" and "I hear you fa shizzle!" messages. The `tcp.len` of all packets were summed:

### Heap and Stack Usage

NOTE: This is out of date. These were obtained when wolfSSL was using the liboqs
      implementations of these algorithms. This is left here for historical
      purposes.

These statistics were obtained by adding the following configuration flags: `--enable-trackmemory --enable-stacksize`.

## Post-Quantum Stateful Hash-Based Signatures

This section covers post-quantum stateful hash-based signature (HBS) schemes such as LMS/HSS, and XMSS/XMSS^MT, for which wolfSSL has recently added support.

### Motivation

Stateful HBS schemes are of growing interest for a number of reasons.
The primary motivation for stateful HBS schemes is post-quantum security. As discussed previously in this appendix, Shor's algorithm would allow a quantum computer to efficiently factorize large integers and compute discrete logarithms, thus completely breaking public-key cryptography schemes such as RSA and ECC.

In contrast, stateful HBS schemes are founded on the security of their underlying hash functions and Merkle trees (typically implemented with SHA256), which are not expected to be broken by the advent of cryptographically relevant quantum computers. For these reasons they have been recommended by NIST SP 800-208 and the NSA's CNSA 2.0 suite. See these two links for more info:

- <https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-208/final>
- <https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071834/-1/-1/0/CSA_CNSA_2.0_ALGORITHMS_.PDF>

Furthermore, the CNSA 2.0 timeline has specified that post-quantum stateful HBS schemes should be used exclusively by 2030, and adoption should begin _immediately_. In fact, adoption of LMS is the earliest requirement in the CNSA 2.0 suite timeline.

However, the nature of stateful HBS schemes requires that significant care is given to their use and tracking their state. In a stateful HBS system, the private key is actually a finite set of one-time signature (OTS) keys, which may never be reused. If the same OTS key were used to sign two different messages, it would be possible for an attacker to fabricate signatures, and the security of the entire scheme would unravel. Therefore, stateful HBS schemes are not suitable for general use such as the public internet.

Instead, because of these unique strengths and characteristics, and NIST and NSA backing, stateful HBS schemes such as LMS/HSS are of particular interest for offline firmware authentication and signature verification, especially on embedded or constrained systems that are expected to have a long operational lifetime and thus need to be resilient against a cryptographically relevant quantum computer.

### LMS/HSS signatures

wolfSSL is adding support for the LMS/HSS hash-based signature scheme to our wolfCrypt embedded crypto engine. This will be achieved by experimental integration with the hash-sigs LMS/HSS library (<https://github.com/cisco/hash-sigs>), similar to our previous libOQS integration.

Leighton-Micali Signatures (LMS), and its multi-tree variant, the Hierarchical Signature System (HSS), is a post-quantum, stateful hash-based signature scheme. It is noted for having small public and private keys, and fast signing and verifying. Its signature sizes are larger, but are tunable via its Winternitz parameter. See these two links from RFC8554 for more details:

- LMS: <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8554>
- HSS: <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8554#section-6>

As previously discussed, the LMS/HSS signature system consists of a finite number of one-time signature (OTS) keys, and thus may only safely generate a finite number of signatures. However the number of signatures, and the signature size, are tunable via a set of defined parameters, which will be discussed next.

#### Supported Parameters

LMS/HSS signatures are defined by 3 parameters:
- levels: number of levels of Merkle trees.
- height: height of an individual Merkle tree.
- Winternitz: number of bits from hash used in a Winternitz chain. Used as a space-time tradeoff for the signature size.

wolfSSL supports all LMS/HSS parameters defined in RFC8554:

- levels = {1..8}
- height = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}
- Winternitz = {1, 2, 4, 8}

The number of available signatures is:
- N = 2 ** (levels * height)

For convenience some parameter sets have been predefined in the enum `wc_LmsParm`. Its values are shown in the table below:

parameter set |  description
--------------------  |  ---------------------------
WC_LMS_PARM_NONE      | Not set, use default (WC_LMS_PARM_L1_H15_W2)
WC_LMS_PARM_L1_H15_W2 | 1 level Merkle tree of 15 height, Winternitz 2
WC_LMS_PARM_L1_H15_W4 | same as above, Winternitz 4
WC_LMS_PARM_L2_H10_W2 | 2 level Merkle tree of 10 height, Winternitz 4
WC_LMS_PARM_L2_H10_W4 | same as above, Winternitz 4
WC_LMS_PARM_L2_H10_W8 | same as above, Winternitz 8
WC_LMS_PARM_L3_H5_W2  | 3 level Merkle tree of 5 height, Winternitz 2
WC_LMS_PARM_L3_H5_W4  | same as above, Winternitz 4
WC_LMS_PARM_L3_H5_W8  | same as above, Winternitz 8
WC_LMS_PARM_L3_H10_W4 | 3 level Merkle tree of 10 height, Winternitz 4
WC_LMS_PARM_L4_H5_W8  | 4 level Merkle tree of 5 height, Winternitz 8

The signature size and number of signatures is shown with respect to the parameter set here:

parameter set |  signature size | number of signatures
--------------------  | -------------------- | --------------------
WC_LMS_PARM_L1_H15_W2 | 4784 | 32768
WC_LMS_PARM_L1_H15_W4 | 2672 | 32768
WC_LMS_PARM_L2_H10_W2 | 9300 | 1048576
WC_LMS_PARM_L2_H10_W4 | 5076 | 1048576
WC_LMS_PARM_L2_H10_W8 | 2964 | 1048576
WC_LMS_PARM_L3_H5_W2  | 13496 | 32768
WC_LMS_PARM_L3_H5_W4  | 7160 | 32768
WC_LMS_PARM_L3_H5_W8  | 3992 | 32768
WC_LMS_PARM_L3_H10_W4 | 7640 | 1073741824
WC_LMS_PARM_L4_H5_W8  | 5340 | 1048576

As can be seen from the tables, signature sizes are primarily determined by the levels and Winternitz parameters, and height to a lesser extent:
- Larger levels values increase signature size significantly.
- Larger height values increase signature size modestly.
- Larger winternitz values will reduce the signature size, at the expense of longer key generation and sign/verify times.

Key generation time is strongly determined by the height of the first level tree. A 3 level, 5 height tree is much faster than 1 level, 15 height at initial key gen, even if the number of available signatures is the same.

#### LMS/HSS Build Instructions

Please see the wolfSSL repo's INSTALL file (https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/INSTALL). Item 17 (Building with hash-sigs lib for LMS/HSS support [EXPERIMENTAL]) has instructions on how to configure and build wolfSSL and the hash-sigs LMS/HSS library.

#### Benchmark Data

The following benchmark data was taken on an 8-core Intel i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz, on Fedora 38 (`6.2.9-300.fc38.x86_64`). The multi-threaded example used 4 worker threads and 4 cores, while the single-threaded example used only a single core.

As discussed in item 17 of the INSTALL file, the hash-sigs lib offers two static libraries:
- `hss_lib.a`: a single-threaded version.
- `hss_lib_thread.a`: a multi-threaded version.

The multi-threaded version will spawn worker threads to accelerate cpu intensive tasks, such as key generation.  This will mainly speedup key generation and signing for all parameter values, and to a lesser extent will speedup verifying for larger levels values.

For reference, wolfSSL was built with the following to obtain both benchmarks:

```text
  ./configure \
    --enable-static \
    --disable-shared \
    --enable-lms=yes \
    --with-liblms=<path to hash sigs install>
```

**multi-threaded benchmark**

The following is benchmark data obtained when built against the multi-threaded `hss_lib_thread.a`, which used 4 worker threads to parallelize intensive tasks, and used 4 cores.

### XMSS/XMSS^MT signatures

wolfSSL is adding support for XMSS/XMSS^MT stateful hash-based signatures. Similar to LMS, this
will be done by experimental integration with the xmss-reference repository
(https://github.com/XMSS/xmss-reference.git), from RFC 8391
(https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8391.html).

The xmss-reference supports `xmss_core_fast`, and `xmss_core` implementations. The `xmss_core_fast`
implementation was designed to prioritize performance with larger private key sizes as a tradeoff.
Our integration uses `xmss_core_fast`, with a patch applied so that the wolfCrypt SHA256 implementation
may be used instead.

The patch may be found here
```pq/stateful_hash_sig/0001-Patch-to-support-wolfSSL-xmss-reference-integration.patch```
in the wolfssl-examples repository: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl-examples.

Overall, XMSS/XMSS^MT is similar to LMS/HSS. For a more detailed comparison see
"LMS vs XMSS: Comparison of two Hash-Based Signature Standards" (https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/349.pdf).


XMSS^MT is the Multi-Tree generalization of XMSS,
analogous to HSS with LMS, with the distinction that the Winternitz value is fixed to `w=16` in
XMSS/XMSS^MT. The public key is slightly larger in XMSS/XMSS^MT (at 68 bytes in XMSS/XMSS^MT, vs 60 bytes in LMS/HSS), while signatures are slightly smaller.

#### Supported Parameters

wolfSSL supports the SHA256 XMSS/XMSS^MT parameter sets from Tables 10 and 11 from NIST SP 800-208 (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/208/final).

parameter set name      | Oid         | n   | w   | h   | d   | h/d | Sig len
----------------------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --
XMSS                    |             |     |     |     |     |     |
"XMSS-SHA2_10_256"      |  0x00000001 |  32 |  16 |  10 |  1  |  10 | 2500
"XMSS-SHA2_16_256"      |  0x00000002 |  32 |  16 |  16 |  1  |  16 | 2692
"XMSS-SHA2_20_256"      |  0x00000003 |  32 |  16 |  20 |  1  |  20 | 2820
XMSS^MT                 |             |     |     |     |     |     |
"XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256"  |  0x00000001 |  32 |  16 |  20 |  2  |  10 | 4963
"XMSSMT-SHA2_20/4_256"  |  0x00000002 |  32 |  16 |  20 |  4  |   5 | 9251
"XMSSMT-SHA2_40/2_256"  |  0x00000003 |  32 |  16 |  40 |  2  |  20 | 5605
"XMSSMT-SHA2_40/4_256"  |  0x00000004 |  32 |  16 |  40 |  4  |  10 | 9893
"XMSSMT-SHA2_40/8_256"  |  0x00000005 |  32 |  16 |  40 |  8  |   5 | 18469
"XMSSMT-SHA2_60/3_256"  |  0x00000006 |  32 |  16 |  60 |  3  |  20 | 8392
"XMSSMT-SHA2_60/6_256"  |  0x00000007 |  32 |  16 |  60 |  6  |  10 | 14824
"XMSSMT-SHA2_60/12_256" |  0x00000008 |  32 |  16 |  60 |  12 |   5 | 27688

In the table above, `n` is the number of bytes in the HASH function, `w` the Winternitz value, `h` the total height of the tree system, and `d` the number of levels of trees.

Key generation time is strongly determined by the height of the
first level tree (or `h/d`), while signature length grows primarily with `d` (the number of hyper
tree levels).

Similar to LMS/HSS, the number of available signatures grows as `2**h`, where h is the
total height of the tree system.
 
#### Benchmark Data

In the following, benchmark data is shown for several XMSS/XMSS^MT parameter sets,
for intel x86_64 and aarch64.  The SHA256 performance on these systems is also listed for reference,
as computing the large number of required hash chains will constitute the bulk of the CPU
work for XMSS/XMSS^MT. Additionally, our patch to xmss-reference substitutes wolfCrypt's SHA256 implementation, and therefore benefits from the same ASM speedups.

As previously mentioned, our xmss integration is using the `xmss_core_fast` implementation from xmss-reference, which has faster performance at the tradeoff of larger private key sizes.

**x86_64**

The following x86_64 benchmark data were taken on an 8-core Intel i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz, on Fedora 38 (`6.2.9-300.fc38.x86_64`). This CPU has `avx avx2` flags, which can accelerate hash operations and be utilized with `--enable-intelasm`.

With `--enable-intelasm`:

### Developer Notes

* If you are trying to thwart the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat model and you are willing to sacrifice some interoperability, then you do not want to advertise support for conventional algorithms in the Supported Groups extension.  Be sure to call `wolfSSL_UseKeyShare()` and `wolfSSL_set_groups()` with your chosen algorithms.  Only calling `wolfSSL_UseKeyShare()` is insufficient as that will advertise your support for quantum-vulnerable algorithms. If your peer does not support post-quantum algorithms, they will then send a HelloRetryRequest which will then result in a connection with a conventional algorithm.
