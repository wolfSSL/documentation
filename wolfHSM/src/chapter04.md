# Library Design / wolfHSM Internals

wolfHSM is a modular and extensible library designed to provide a secure and efficient hardware security module (HSM) API for embedded systems. The library is built around a set of functional components that can be easily configured and combined to meet the specific requirements of a given application. This chapter provides an overview of the key functional components of wolfHSM, including the component architecture, communications layer, non-volatile memory (NVM), key management, cryptographic operations, and hardware security module (HSM) support.

## Generic Component Architecture

To support easily porting wolfHSM to different hardware platforms and build
environments, each component of wolfHSM is designed to have a common initialization,
configuration, and context storage architecture to allow compile-time, link-
time, and/or run-time selection of functional components. Hardware specifics
are abstracted from the logical operations by associating callback functions
with untyped context structures, referenced as a `void*`.

### Example component initialization

The prototypical compile-time static instance configuration and initialization
sequence of a wolfHSM component is:

```c
#include "wolfhsm/component.h"        /* wolfHSM abstract API reference for a component */
#include "port/vendor/mycomponent.h"  /* Platform specific definitions of configuration
                                       * and context structures, as well as declarations of
                                       * callback functions */

/* Provide the lookup table for function callbacks for mycomponent. Note the type
is the abstract type provided in wolfhsm/component.h */
whComponentCb my_cb[1] = {MY_COMPONENT_CB};

/* Fixed configuration data.  Note that pertinent data is copied out of the structure
 * during init() */
const myComponentConfig my_config = {
    .my_number = 3,
    .my_string = "This is a string",
}

/* Static allocation of the dynamic state of the myComponent. */
myComponentContext my_context[1] = {0};

/* Initialization of the component using platform-specific callbacks */
const whComponentConfig comp_config[1] = {
        .cb = my_cb,
        .context = my_context,
        .config = my_config
    };
whComponentContext comp_context[1] = {0};
int rc = wh_Component_Init(comp_context, comp_config);

rc = wh_Component_DoSomething(comp_context, 1, 2, 3);
rc = wh_Component_CleanUp(comp_context);
```

## Communications

The communication layer of wolfHSM is designed to provide reliable, bidirectional, and packet-based communication between clients and servers. This layer abstracts the underlying transport mechanisms, allowing for flexibility and modularity. A key aspect of wolfHSM communication is split request and response functions for both client and server, enabling synchronous polling of message reception or asynchronous handling based on interrupt/event support.

### Key Components

- Client/Server APIs: Main interface for communicating between client and server. These are the APIs that are directly used by user applications.
- Comms layer: Defines the format and structure of messages exchanged between clients and servers, and provides an abstract interface to the underlying transport layer implementation, exposing a consistent interface for sending and receiving messages.
- Transport Layer: Concrete implementations of the underlying transport. Defines how data is actually transported between client and server.

### Client/Server APIs

High-level client and server APIs (defined in `wolfhsm/wh_client.h` and `wolfhsm/wh_server.h`) are the primary interface for communication. These functions abstract the low level communications details from the caller, providing a simple split transaction interface for logical operations.

For example, using the client API to send an echo request to the server:

```c
/* send the echo request */
wh_Client_EchoRequest(&clientCtx, sendLen, &sendBuffer));

/* optionally do stuff */

/* poll for the server response */
while (WH_ERROR_NOTREADY == wh_Client_EchoResponse(client, &recv_len, recv_buffer));
```

### Comms Layer

The comms layer encapsulates the messaging structure and control logic to send and receive data from lower level transports. The comms layer is directly invoked by the higher level client and server APIs. The comms layer provides comm client and comm server abstractions that hold communication state and provide the abstract interface functions to interact with lower level transports. The comms layer API consists of send and receive functions for requests and responses, where the requests and responses pertain to messages rather than high level operations.

Each client is only allowed a single outstanding request to the server at a time.
The server will process a single request at a time to ensure client isolation.

#### Messages

Messages comprise a header with a variable length payload.  The header indicates
the sequence id, and type of a request or response.  The header also provides
additional fields to provide auxiliary flags or session information.

```c
/* wolfhsm/wh_comm.h */

typedef struct {
    uint16_t magic;
    uint16_t kind;
    uint16_t seq;
    uint16_t size;
} whCommHeader;
```

Messages are used to encapsulate the request data necessary for the server to
execute the desired function and for the response to provide the results of the
function execution back to the client.  Message types are grouped based on the
component that is performing the function and uniquely identify which of the
enumerated functions is being performed.  To ensure compatibility (endianness
and version), messages include a Magic field which has known values used to
indicate what operations are necessary to demarshall data passed within the
payload for native processing.  Each functional component has a "remote"
implementation that converts between native values and the "on-the-wire" message
formats.  The servers ensures the response format matches the request format.

In addition to passing data contents within messages, certain message types also
support passing shared or mapped memory pointers, especially for performance-
critical operations where the server component may be able to directly access
the data in a DMA fashion.  To avoid integer pointer size (IPS) and `size_t`
differences, all pointers and sizes should be sent as `uint64_t` when
possible.

Messages are encoded in the "on-the-wire" format using the Magic field of the
header indicating the specified endianness of structure members as well as the
version of the communications header (currently 0x01).  Server components that
process request messages translate the provided values into native format,
perform the task, and then reencode the result into the format of the request.
Client response handling is not required to process messages that do not match
the request format. Encoded messages assume the same size and layout as the
native structure, with the endianness specified by the Magic field.

Here is an example of how the client comm layer sends a request:

```c
uint16_t req_magic = wh_COMM_MAGIC_NATIVE;
uint16_t req_type = 123;
uint16_t request_id;
char* req_data = "RequestData";
rc = wh_CommClient_SendRequest(context, req_magic, req_type, &request_id,
                    sizeof(req_data), req_data);
/* Do other work */

uint16_t resp_magic, resp_type, resp_id, resp_size;
char response_data[20];
while((rc = wh_CommClient_RecvResponse(context,&resp_magic, &resp_type, &resp_id,
                    &resp_size, resp_data)) == WH_ERROR_NOTREADY) {
        /* Do other work or yield */
}
```

Note that transport errors passed into the message layer are expected to be fatal and the
client/server should Cleanup any context as a result.

### Transports

Transports provide intact packets (byte sequences) of variable size (up to a
maximum MTU), to the messaging layer for the library to process as a request or
response. Transports implement the abstract interface defined by `whTransportClientCb`
and are invoked directly by the commClient/commServer when needing to send and
receive data.

Custom transport modules that implement the `whTransportClientCb` interface
can be registered with the server and client and then are automatically used
via the standard server and client request/response functions.

Examples of a memory buffer transport module and a POSIX TCP socket transport can be found in wolfHSM's supported transports.

#### Supported Transports

wolfHSM ships with two built-in transports: a memory buffer transport (`wh_transport_mem.c`) and a POSIX TCP socket transport (`port/posix_transport_tcp.c`).

The memory transport is the default transport for most embedded wolfHSM ports, and is part of the core wolfHSM library. It provides a concrete implementation of the transport callbacks using shared memory blocks between client and server. The shared memory transport mechanism works by allocating two blocks of memory, one for incoming requests and one for outgoing responses. The client writes requests to the incoming memory block and reads responses from the outgoing memory block. The server reads requests from the incoming memory block and writes responses to the outgoing memory block. Each block contains control and status flags signaling to the consumer when it is ready for use. This mechanism is designed to be fast and efficient, as it avoids the need for system calls or network communication.


The POSIX TCP transport is part of the wolfHSM POSIX port. It uses TCP sockets as the transport medium for data between client and server. The sockets are IPv4 only and non-blocking.

## Non Volatile Memory

Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) in the context of wolfHSM is used to manage persistent objects with metadata and data blocks. The NVM library ensures reliable, atomic operations to ensure transactions are fully committed before returning success. Key operations include adding, listing, reading, and destroying objects, as well as obtaining associated metadata.

High level NVM features include:

- API’s to associate metadata (ID, Label, Length, Access, Flags) with variable-sized data within accessible NVM
- Always recoverable using 2 erasable partitions with status flags
- Objects are added by using the next entry and programmed into free space
- Duplicated id’s are allowed but only the latest is readable
- Objects are destroyed by copying the entire space to the inactive partition without the listed objects
- Internal epoch counters used to identify the later objects during recovery


### NVM Metadata

In the wolfHSM library, Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) metadata is used to manage and describe objects stored in NVM. This metadata provides essential information about each object, such as its identifier, access permissions, flags, and other attributes. The metadata ensures that objects can be reliably managed, accessed, and manipulated within the NVM.

```
/* User-specified metadata for an NVM object */
typedef struct {
    whNvmId id;             /* Unique identifier */
    whNvmAccess access;     /* Access Permissions */
    whNvmFlags flags;       /* Additional flags */
    whNvmSize len;          /* Length of data in bytes */
    uint8_t label[WOLFHSM_NVM_LABEL_LEN];
} whNvmMetadata;
```

- ID (`whNvmId id`): A unique identifier for the NVM object. This ID is used to reference and access the specific object within the NVM. It allows for operations like reading, writing, and deleting the object.
- Access (`whNvmAccess access`): Defines the access permissions for the object. This field specifies who can access the object and under what conditions. It helps enforce security policies and ensures that only authorized entities can interact with the object.
- Flags (`whNvmFlags flags`): Additional flags that provide extra information or modify the behavior of the object.  Flags can be used to mark objects with special attributes or states, such as whether the object is read-only, temporary, or has other specific properties.
Length (whNvmSize len): The length of the data associated with the object, in bytes.
- Label (`uint8_t label[]`): A human-readable label or name for the object.

### NVM Architecture

The wolfHSM server follows the generic component architecture approach to handle Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) operations. The configuration is divided into generic and specific parts, allowing for flexibility and customization.

1. **Generic Configuration (wh_nvm.h):** This header file defines the generic interface for NVM operations. It includes function pointers for NVM operations like `nvm_Read`, `nvm_Write`, `nvm_Erase`, and `nvm_Init`. These function pointers are part of the `whNvmConfig` structure, which is used to bind an actual NVM implementation to the abstract NVM interface.

2. **Specific Configuration (wh_nvm_flash.c, wh_nvm_flash.h):** These files provide a specific implementation of the NVM interface for flash memory. The functions defined here adhere to the function signatures defined in the generic interface, allowing them to be used as the actual implementation for the NVM operations.

The `whServerContext` structure includes a `whNvmConfig` member. This is used to bind the NVM operations to the server context, allowing the server to perform NVM operations using the configured NVM interface.

Steps required to initialize NVM on the server are:

1. Allocate and initialize a `whNvmConfig` structure, providing bindings to a specific NVM back-end (e.g., from `wh_nvm_flash.c`).
2. Allocate and initialize a `whServerConfig` structure, and set its `nvmConfig` member to the `whNvmConfig` structure initialized in step 1.
3. Allocate a `whServerContext` structure.
4. Initialize the server with the `whServerConfig` structure by calling `wh_Server_Init()`.

This allows the server to use the configured NVM operations on the given backing store, which can be easily swapped out by providing a different implementation in the `whNvmConfig` structure.

### NVM Back-Ends

Currently, wolfHSM only supports one NVM back-end provider: the NVM flash module (`wh_nvm_flash.c`). This module provides a concrete implementation of the NMV interface functions (`wh_nvm.h`), mapping the NVM data store to a flash memory device. The low-level flash drivers are device-specific and themselves specified as generic components (`wh_flash.h`) that can be swapped out depending on the target hardware.

## Key Management

The wolfHSM library provides comprehensive key management capabilities, including storing, loading, and exporting keys from non-volatile memory, caching of frequently used keys in RAM for fast access, and interacting with hardware-exclusive device keys. Keys are stored in non-volatile memory along side other NVM objects with corresponding access protections. wolfHSM will automatically load keys into the necessary cryptographic hardware when the key is selected for use with a specific consumer. More information on the key management API can be found in the [client library](./chapter05.md) and [API documentation](./appendix01.md) sections.

## Cryptographic Operations

One of the defining features of wolfHSM is that it enables the client application to use the wolfCrypt API directly, but with the underlying cryptographic operations actually being executed on the HSM core. This is an incredibly powerful feature for a number of reasons:

- client applications are dramatically simpler as they do not need to set up the complicated communication transactions required to pass data back and forth between the HSM
- local and remote HSM implementations can be easily switched between by changing a single parameter to the wolfCrypt call, enabling maximum flexibility of implementation and ease of development. Client application development can be prototyped with local instances of wolfCrypt before the HSM core is even brought on-line
- the wolfHSM API is simple, stable, well documented, and battle tested

The ability to easily redirect wolfCrypt API calls to the wolfHSM server is based on the "crypto callback" (a.k.a cryptocb) of wolfCrypt.


The wolfHSM client is able to redirect wolfCrypt API calls to the wolfHSM server by implementing the remote procedure call logic as a [crypto callback](https://www.wolfssl.com/documentation/manuals/wolfssl/chapter06.html#crypto-callbacks-cryptocb). The Crypto callback framework in wolfCrypt enables users to override the default implementation of select cryptographic algorithms and provide their own custom implementations at runtime. The wolfHSM client library registers a crypto callback with wolfCrypt that transforms each wolfCrypt crypto API function into a remote procedure call to the HSM server to be executed in a secure environment.  Crypto callbacks are selected for use based on the device ID (`devId`) parameter accepted by most wolfCrypt API calls.

wolfHSM defines the `WOLFHSM_DEV_ID` value to represent the wolfHSM server crypto device, which can be passed to any wolfCrypt function as the `devId` parameter. wolfCrypt APIs that support the `devId` parameter can be passed `WOLFHSM_DEV_ID` and, if supported, the cryptographic operation will be automatically exectued by the wolfHSM server.

### Hardware Cryptography Support

Many HSM devices also have hardware acceleration capabilities for select algorithms available. In these cases, the wolfHSM server may also support offloading the HSM server-side cryptography to device hardware. If supported, the wolfHSM server can be configured to do this automatically with no input required from the user. Any port-specific hardware acceleration capabilities will be documented in the wolfHSM port for that device.
