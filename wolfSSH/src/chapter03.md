# Getting Started

After downloading and building wolfSSH, there are some automated test and example programs to show the uses of the library.

## Testing

###  wolfSSH Unit Test

The wolfSSH unit test is used to verify the API. Both positive and negative test cases are performed. This test can be run manually and it additionally runs as part of other automated processes such as the make and make check commands.

All examples and tests must be run from the wolfSSH home directory so the test tools can find their certificates and keys.

To run the unit test manually:
```
$ ./tests/unit.test
```
or
```
$ make check (when using autoconf)
```

### Testing Notes

After cloning the repository, be sure to make the testing private keys read- only for the user, otherwise ssh_client will tell you to do it.
```
$ chmod 0600 ./keys/gretel-key-rsa.pem ./keys/hansel-key-rsa.pem \
             ./keys/gretel-key-ecc.pem ./keys/hansel-key-ecc.pem
```

Authentication against the example echoserver can be done with a password or public key. To use a password the command line:
```
$ ssh -p 22222 USER@localhost
```

Where the _USER_ and password pairs are:
```
jill:upthehill
jack:fetchapail
```

To use public key authentication use the command line:
```
$ ssh -i ./keys/USER-key-TYPE.pem -p 22222 USER@localhost
```

Where the _USER_ can be gretel or hansel, and TYPE is rsa or ecc.

Keep in mind, the echoserver has several fake accounts in its wsUserAuth callback function. (jack, jill, hansel, and gretel) When the shell support is enabled, those fake accounts will not work. They don't exist in the system's passwd file. The users will authenticate, but the server will err out because they don't exist in the system. You can add your own username to the password or public key list in the echoserver. That account will be logged into a shell started by the echoserver with the privileges of the user running echoserver.

## Examples

###  wolfSSH Echo Server

The echoserver is the workhorse of wolfSSH. It originally only allowed one to authenticate one of the canned account and would repeat the characters typed into it. When enabling shell support, see the later section, it can spawn a user shell. It will need an actual user name on the machine and an updated user authentication callback function to validate the credentials. The echoserver can also handle SCP and SFTP connections. From the terminal run:
```
    $ ./examples/echoserver/echoserver -f
```

The option `-f` enables echo-only mode. From another terminal run:
```
    $ ssh jill@localhost -p 22222
```

When prompted for a password, enter "upthehill". The server will send a canned
banner to the client:
```
    wolfSSH Example Echo Server
```

Characters typed into the client will be echoed to the screen by the server.
If the characters are echoed twice, the client has local echo enabled. The
echo server isn't being a proper terminal so the CR/LF translation will not
work as expected.

The following control characters will trigger special actions in the
echoserver:

- CTRL-C: Terminate the connection.
- CTRL-E: Print out some session statistics.
- CTRL-F: Trigger a new key exchange.

The echoserver tool accepts the following command line options:
```
    -1             exit after a single (one) connection
    -e             expect ECC public key from client
    -E             use ECC private key
    -f             echo input
    -p <num>       port to accept on, default 22222
    -N             use non-blocking sockets
    -d <string>    set the home directory for SFTP connections
    -j <file>      load in a public key to accept from peer
```

###  wolfSSH Client

The client establishes a connection to an SSH server. In its simplest mode,
it sends the string "Hello, wolfSSH!" to the server, prints the response,
and then exits. With the pseudo terminal option, the client will be a real
client.

The client tool accepts the following command line options:
```
    -h <host>      host to connect to, default 127.0.0.1
    -p <num>       port to connect on, default 22222
    -u <username>  username to authenticate as (REQUIRED)
    -P <password>  password for username, prompted if omitted
    -e             use sample ecc key for user
    -i <filename>  filename for the user's private key
    -j <filename>  filename for the user's public key
    -x             exit after successful connection without doing
                   read/write
    -N             use non-blocking sockets
    -t             use psuedo terminal
    -c <command>   executes remote command and pipe stdin/stdout
    -a             Attempt to use SSH-AGENT
```

### wolfSSH portfwd

The portfwd tool establishes a connection to an SSH server and sets up a
listener for local port forwarding or requests a listener for remote port
forwarding. After a connection, the tool terminates.

The portfwd tool accepts the following command line options:
```
    -h <host>      host to connect to, default 127.0.0.1
    -p <num>       port to connect on, default 22222
    -u <username>  username to authenticate as (REQUIRED)
    -P <password>  password for username, prompted if omitted
    -F <host>      host to forward from, default 0.0.0.0
    -f <num>       host port to forward from (REQUIRED)
    -T <host>      host to forward to, default to host
    -t <num>       port to forward to (REQUIRED)
```

### wolfSSH scpclient

The scpclient, wolfscp, establishes a connection to an SSH server and copies
the specified files from or to the local machine. When using the wolfSSH
example, absolute paths must be used, and directories must end with a `/`.

The scpclient tool accepts the following command line options:
```
    -H <host>      host to connect to, default 127.0.0.1
    -p <num>       port to connect on, default 22222
    -u <username>  username to authenticate as (REQUIRED)
    -P <password>  password for username, prompted if omitted
    -L <from>:<to> copy from local to server
    -S <from>:<to> copy from server to local
```

### wolfSSH sftpclient

The sftpclient, wolfsftp, establishes a connection to an SSH server and
allows directory navigation, getting and putting files, making and removing
directories, etc.

The sftpclient tool accepts the following command line options:
```
    -h <host>      host to connect to, default 127.0.0.1
    -p <num>       port to connect on, default 22222
    -u <username>  username to authenticate as (REQUIRED)
    -P <password>  password for username, prompted if omitted
    -d <path>      set the default local path
    -N             use non blocking sockets
    -e             use ECC user authentication
    -l <filename>  local filename
    -r <filename>  remote filename
    -g             put local filename as remote filename
    -G             get remote filename as local filename
```

### wolfSSH server

This tool is a place holder.


## SCP

wolfSSH includes server-side support for scp, which includes support for both copying files 'to' the server, and copying files 'from' the server. Both
single file and recursive directory copy are supported with the default
send and receive callbacks.

To compile wolfSSH with scp support, use the `--enable-scp` build option
or define `WOLFSSL_SCP`:
```
    $ ./configure --enable-scp
    $ make
```


The wolfSSL example server has been set up to accept a single scp request,
and is compiled by default when compiling the wolfSSH library. To start the
example server, run:

    $ ./examples/server/server

Standard scp commands can be used on the client side. The following are a
few examples, where `scp` represents the ssh client you are using.

To copy a single file TO the server, using the default example user "jill":

    $ scp -P 22222 <local_file> jill@127.0.0.1:<remote_path>

To copy the same single file TO the server, but with timestamp and in
verbose mode:

    $ scp -v -p -P 22222 <local_file> jill@127.0.0.1:<remote_path>

To recursively copy a directory TO the server:

    $ scp -P 22222 -r <local_dir> jill@127.0.0.1:<remote_dir>

To copy a single file FROM the server to the local client:

    $ scp -P 22222 jill@127.0.0.1:<remote_file> <local_path>

To recursively copy a directory FROM the server to the local client:

    $ scp -P 22222 -r jill@127.0.0.1:<remote_dir> <local_path>

## SFTP

wolfSSH provides server and client side support for SFTP version 3. This
allows the user to set up an encrypted connection for managing file systems.

To compile wolfSSH with SFTP support, use the `--enable-sftp` build option or
define `WOLFSSH_SFTP`:

```
    $ ./configure --enable-sftp
    $ make
```

For full API usage and implementation details, please see the wolfSSH User
Manual.

The SFTP client created is located in the directory examples/sftpclient/ and the
server is ran using the same echoserver as with wolfSSH.

```
    src/wolfssh$ ./examples/sftpclient/wolfsftp
```

A full list of supported commands can be seen with typeing "help" after a
connection.

```
    wolfSSH sftp> help

    Commands :
        cd  <string>                      change directory
        chmod <mode> <path>               change mode
        get <remote file> <local file>    pulls file(s) from server
        ls                                list current directory
        mkdir <dir name>                  creates new directory on server
        put <local file> <remote file>    push file(s) to server
        pwd                               list current path
        quit                              exit
        rename <old> <new>                renames remote file
        reget <remote file> <local file>  resume pulling file
        reput <remote file> <local file>  resume pushing file
        <crtl + c>                        interrupt get/put cmd
```
An example of connecting to another system would be

```
    src/wolfssh$ ./examples/sftpclient/wolfsftp -p 22 -u user -h 192.168.1.111
```

##  Shell Support

wolfSSH's example echoserver can now fork a shell for the user trying to log in. This currently has only been tested on Linux and macOS. The file echoserver.c must be modified to have the user's credentials in the user authentication callback, or the user authentication callback needs to be changed to verify the provided password.

To compile wolfSSH with shell support, use the --enable-shell build option or define WOLFSSH_SHELL:
```
$ ./configure --enable-shell
$ make
```

By default, the echoserver will try to start a shell. To use the echo testing behavior, give the echoserver the command line option -f.
```
$ ./examples/echoserver/echoserver -f
```

## Post-Quantum

wolfSSH now supports the post-quantum algorithm Kyber. It uses the NIST
submission's Level 1 parameter set implemented by liboqs via an integration
with wolfSSH. It is hybridized with ECDHE over the P-256 ECC curve.

In order be able to use liboqs, you must have it built and installed on your
system. We support the 0.7.0 release of liboqs. You can download it from the
following link:

```
    https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/archive/refs/tags/0.7.0.tar.gz
```

Once unpacked, this would be sufficient:

```
    $ cd liboqs-0.7.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DOQS_USE_OPENSSL=0 ..
    $ make all
    $ sudo make install
```


In order to enable support for Kyber Level1 hybridized with ECDHE over the P-256
ECC curve in wolfSSH, use the `--with-liboqs` build option during configuration:

```
    $ ./configure --with-liboqs
```

The wolfSSH client and server will automatically negotiate using Kyber Level1
hybridized with ECDHE over the P-256 ECC curve if this feature is enabled.

```
    $ ./examples/echoserver/echoserver -f

    $ ./examples/client/client -u jill -P upthehill
```

On the client side, you will see the following output:

```
Server said: Hello, wolfSSH!
```

If you want to see inter-operability with OpenQauntumSafe's fork of OpenSSH, you
can build and execute the fork while the echoserver is running. Download the
release from here:

```
    https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/archive/refs/tags/OQS-OpenSSH-snapshot-2021-08.tar.gz
```

The following is sufficient for build and execution:

```
    $ tar xmvf openssh-OQS-OpenSSH-snapshot-2021-08.tar.gz
    $ cd openssh-OQS-OpenSSH-snapshot-2021-08/
    $ ./configure --with-liboqs-dir=/usr/local
    $ make all
    $ ./ssh -o"KexAlgorithms +ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256" \
      -o"PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa" \
      -o"HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa" \
      jill@localhost -p 22222
```

NOTE: when prompted, enter the password which is "upthehill".

You can type a line of text and when you press enter, the line will be echoed
back. Use CTRL-C to terminate the connection.


## Certificate Support

wolfSSH can accept X.509 certificates in place of just public keys when
authenticating a user.

To compile wolfSSH with X.509 support, use the `--enable-certs` build option
or define `WOLFSSH_CERTS`:

```
    $ ./configure --enable-certs
    $ make
```

To provide a CA root certificate to validate a user's certificate, give the
echoserver the command line option `-a`.

```
    $ ./examples/echoserver/echoserver -a ./keys/ca-cert-ecc.pem
```

The echoserver and client have a fake user named "john" whose certificate
will be used for authentication.

An example echoserver/client connection using the example certificate
john-cert.der would be:

```
    $ ./examples/echoserver/echoserver -a ./keys/ca-cert-ecc.pem -K john:./keys/john-cert.der

    $ ./examples/client/client -u john -J ./keys/john-cert.der -i ./keys/john-key.der
```
