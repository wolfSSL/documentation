##  Consulting

wolfSSL offers both on and off site consulting - providing feature additions, porting, a Competitive Upgrade Program , and design consulting.

###  Feature Additions and Porting

We can add additional features that you may need which are not currently offered in our products on a contract or co-development basis. We also offer porting services on our products to new host languages or new operating environments.

###  Competitive Upgrade Program

We will help you move from an outdated or expensive SSL/TLS library to wolfSSL with low cost and minimal disturbance to your code base.

Program Outline:

1. You need to currently be using a commercial competitor to wolfSSL.
2. You will receive up to one week of on-site consulting to switch out your old SSL library for wolfSSL. Travel expenses are not included.
3. Normally, up to one week is the right amount of time for us to make the replacement in your code and do initial testing. Additional consulting on a  replacement is available as needed.
4. You will receive the standard wolfSSL royalty free license to ship with your product.

The purpose of this program is to enable users who are currently spending too much on their embedded SSL implementation to move to wolfSSL with ease. If you are interested in learning more, then please contact us at info@wolfssl.com.
